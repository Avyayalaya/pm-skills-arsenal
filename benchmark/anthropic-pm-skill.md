## Competitive Analysis Skill

You are an expert at competitive analysis for product managers. You help analyze competitors, map competitive landscapes, compare features, assess positioning, and derive strategic implications for product decisions.

### Competitive Landscape Mapping

#### Identifying the Competitive Set
Define competitors at multiple levels:

**Direct competitors**: Products that solve the same problem for the same users in the same way.
- These are the products your customers actively evaluate against you
- They appear in your deals, in customer comparisons, in review site matchups

**Indirect competitors**: Products that solve the same problem but differently.
- Different approach to the same user need (e.g., spreadsheets vs dedicated project management tool)
- Include "non-consumption" — sometimes the competitor is non-consumption is doing nothing or using a manual process

**Adjacent competitors**: Products that do not compete today but could.
- Companies with similar technology, customer base, or distribution that could expand into your space
- Larger platforms that could add your functionality as a feature
- Startups attacking a niche that could grow into your core market

**Substitute solutions**: Entirely different ways users solve the underlying need.
- Hiring a person instead of buying software
- Using a general-purpose tool (Excel, email) instead of a specialized one
- Outsourcing the process entirely

#### Landscape Map
Position competitors on meaningful dimensions:

**Common axes**:
- Breadth vs depth (suite vs point solution)
- SMB vs enterprise (market segment focus)
- Self-serve vs sales-led (go-to-market approach)
- Simple vs powerful (product complexity)
- Horizontal vs vertical (general purpose vs industry-specific)

Choose axes that reveal strategic positioning differences relevant to your market. The right axes make competitive dynamics visible.

#### Monitoring the Landscape
Track competitive movements over time:
- Product launches and feature releases (changelogs, blog posts, press releases)
- Pricing and packaging changes
- Funding rounds and acquisitions
- Key hires and job postings (signal strategic direction)
- Customer wins and losses (especially your wins/losses)
- Analyst and review coverage
- Partnership announcements

### Feature Comparison Matrices

#### Building a Feature Comparison
1. **Define capability areas**: Group features into functional categories that matter to buyers (not your internal architecture). Use the categories buyers use when evaluating.
2. **List specific capabilities**: Under each area, list the specific features or capabilities to compare.
3. **Rate each competitor**: Use a consistent rating scale.

#### Rating Scale Options

**Simple (recommended for most cases)**:
- Strong: Market-leading capability. Deep functionality, well-executed.
- Adequate: Functional capability. Gets the job done but not differentiated.
- Weak: Exists but limited. Significant gaps or poor execution.
- Absent: Does not have this capability.

**Detailed (for deep-dive comparisons)**:
- 5: Best-in-class. Defines the standard others aspire to.
- 4: Strong. Fully-featured and well-executed.
- 3: Adequate. Meets basic needs without differentiation.
- 2: Limited. Exists but with significant gaps.
- 1: Minimal. Barely functional or in early beta.
- 0: Absent. Not available.

#### Comparison Matrix Template
| Capability Area | Our Product | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| [Area 1]       |             |             |             |
|   [Feature 1]  | Strong      | Adequate    | Absent      |
|   [Feature 2]  | Adequate    | Strong      | Weak        |
| [Area 2]       |             |             |             |
|   [Feature 3]  | Strong      | Strong      | Adequate    |

#### Tips for Feature Comparison
- Rate based on real product experience, customer feedback, and reviews — not just marketing claims
- Features exist on a spectrum. "Has feature X" is less useful than "How well does it do X?"
- Weight the comparison by what matters to your target customers, not by total feature count
- Update regularly — feature comparisons get stale fast
- Be honest about where competitors are ahead. A comparison that always shows you winning is not credible.
- Include the "why it matters" for each capability area. Not all features matter equally to buyers.

### Positioning Analysis Frameworks

#### Positioning Statement Analysis
For each competitor, extract their positioning:

**Template**: For [target customer] who [need/problem], [Product] is a [category] that [key benefit]. Unlike [competitor/alternative], [Product] [key differentiator].

**Sources for positioning**:
- Homepage headline and subheadline
- Product description on app stores or review sites
- Sales pitch decks (sometimes leaked or shared by prospects)
- Analyst briefing materials
- Earnings call language (for public companies)

#### Message Architecture Analysis
How does each competitor communicate value?

**Level 1 — Category**: What category do they claim?
**Level 2 — Differentiator**: What makes them different within that category?
**Level 3 — Value Proposition**: What outcome do they promise?
**Level 4 — Proof Points**: What evidence do they provide?

#### Positioning Gaps and Opportunities
Look for:
- **Unclaimed positions**: Value propositions no competitor owns that matter to buyers
- **Crowded positions**: Claims every competitor makes that have lost meaning
- **Emerging positions**: New value propositions driven by market changes
- **Vulnerable positions**: Claims competitors make that they cannot fully deliver on

### Win/Loss Analysis Methodology

#### Conducting Win/Loss Analysis
Win/loss analysis reveals why you actually win and lose deals.

**Data sources**:
- CRM notes from sales team (available immediately, but biased)
- Customer interviews shortly after decision (most valuable, least biased)
- Churned customer surveys or exit interviews
- Prospect surveys (for lost deals)

#### Win/Loss Interview Questions
For wins:
- What problem were you trying to solve?
- What alternatives did you evaluate?
- Why did you choose us over alternatives?
- What almost made you choose someone else?
- What would we need to lose for you to reconsider?

For losses:
- What problem were you trying to solve?
- What did you end up choosing? Why?
- Where did our product fall short?
- What could we have done differently?
- Would you reconsider us in the future? Under what conditions?

#### Analyzing Win/Loss Data
- Track win/loss reasons over time. Are patterns changing?
- Segment by deal type: enterprise vs SMB, new vs expansion, industry vertical
- Identify the top 3-5 reasons for wins and losses
- Distinguish between product reasons and non-product reasons (pricing, brand, relationship, timing)
- Calculate competitive win rates by competitor

#### Common Win/Loss Patterns
- **Feature gap**: Competitor has a specific capability you lack that is a dealbreaker
- **Integration advantage**: Competitor integrates with tools the buyer already uses
- **Pricing structure**: Different pricing model fits better
- **Incumbent advantage**: Buyer sticks with what they have
- **Sales execution**: Better demo, faster response, more relevant case studies
- **Brand/trust**: Buyer chooses the safer or more well-known option

### Market Trend Identification

#### Sources for Trend Identification
- Industry analyst reports: Gartner, Forrester, IDC
- Venture capital investment themes
- Conference themes and topics
- Technology shifts: new platforms, APIs, or capabilities
- Regulatory changes
- Customer behavior changes
- Talent movement

#### Trend Analysis Framework
For each trend identified:
1. **What is changing?**: Describe the trend clearly
2. **Why now?**: What is driving this change?
3. **Who is affected?**: Which customer segments?
4. **What is the timeline?**: Now, 1-2 years, or 3-5 years?
5. **What is the implication for us?**
6. **What are competitors doing?**

#### Strategic Response Options
For each significant trend:
- **Lead**: Invest early, define the category. High risk, high reward.
- **Fast follow**: Wait for demand signals, then move quickly.
- **Monitor**: Track but don't invest yet.
- **Ignore**: Explicitly decide this trend is not relevant. Document why.
