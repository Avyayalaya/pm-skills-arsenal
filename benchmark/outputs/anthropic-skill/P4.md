## Competitive Response Strategy: Visier Free Tier — Complete Competitive Brief

**Prepared for:** CEO (Monday delivery)
**Prepared by:** VP Product
**Context:** Visier raised $125M and launched a free tier targeting sub-500 employee companies. We are #2 in market at $30M ARR, 200% NRR, 150 customers in this exact segment. 3 customers downgraded in last 30 days.

## Competitive Landscape Mapping

### Identifying the Competitive Set

**Direct Competitors** (products customers actively evaluate against us):

- **Visier** — market leader, now with free tier for sub-500 employees
- **Workday Peakon** — employee experience analytics, bundled into Workday HCM
- **Culture Amp** — engagement and performance analytics, similar ICP

**Indirect Competitors** (solve same problem differently):

- **Tableau / Power BI connected to HRIS** — DIY analytics on existing tools; common in mid-market companies with a BI team
- **BambooHR / Rippling built-in reporting** — "good enough" analytics as a feature of HRIS platforms, not dedicated analytics
- **Lattice** — performance and engagement, overlapping analytics use cases

**Adjacent Competitors** (don't compete today, could expand):

- **Workday (core HCM)** — could deepen analytics natively if they choose to
- **Microsoft Viva Insights** — Microsoft 365-connected workforce analytics; distribution advantage through M365 installed base
- **Salesforce** — less likely but has data infrastructure and HR tech ambitions

**Substitute Solutions** (entirely different ways to solve the problem):

- **HR consulting firms** — outsource the analytics function entirely; more common at sub-200 employee stage
- **Excel / Google Sheets** — manual workforce reports; the "do nothing" competitor
- **Internal BI teams** — companies with analytics capacity build dashboards in Looker or Metabase

**The non-consumption competitor deserves special attention here.** Many companies in our ICP (50-500 employees) don't have dedicated HR analytics at all. Visier's free tier is not just competing with us — it's attacking non-consumption, growing the total market while simultaneously pressuring our installed base. This is the most strategically significant aspect of their move.

```

**Key insight from the map:** Visier's free tier move is not a repositioning — it's a land-and-expand tactic. They remain a mid-market-to-enterprise product. The free tier is a top-of-funnel weapon aimed at our segment, with the intent to grow into those accounts as they scale. The real threat is 24-36 months out when today's 200-person free-tier customers become 800-person paying customers — and Visier already has two years of their data.

## Feature Comparison Matrix

### Defining the Capability Areas (as Buyers See Them)

The following capability areas reflect what HR buyers in our segment actually evaluate, based on deal conversations and customer feedback. These are not internal product categories — they're buyer evaluation criteria.

| Capability Area | Why it Matters to Buyers |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Core workforce analytics | The table-stakes reason they buy at all |
| Predictive / flight risk | The high-value use case that drives budget approval |
| Benchmarking data | External context is a frequent request — "how do we compare?" |
| HRIS integrations | Integration breadth determines deployment feasibility |
| Self-serve configuration | HR teams want to build reports without engineering |
| Implementation & time-to-value | Sub-500 companies have no IT resources to spare |
| Customer success & support | Smaller companies rely on vendor support more heavily |
| Data security & compliance | Increasingly table-stakes with people data |

### Feature Comparison Matrix

| Capability Area | Our Product | Visier (Free Tier) | Visier (Paid) | Culture Amp |
|----------------|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|
| **Core workforce analytics** | | | | |
| Headcount & turnover reporting | Strong | Adequate | Strong | Adequate |
| Compensation analytics | Strong | Weak* | Strong | Weak |

*Visier Free Tier ratings are estimates based on publicly available information about freemium HR analytics limitations and Visier's announced free tier. These must be validated by product intelligence this week.*

**Key finding from the matrix:** If the free tier genuinely lacks predictive analytics, custom integrations, dedicated CSM, and custom metric creation — then it is a feature-limited lead-gen tool, not a competitive replacement for our product. The sales battle becomes: "are your customers choosing free because they value those features less than we assumed, or because they're price-constrained?"

## Positioning Analysis

### Positioning Statement Analysis

**Visier (current):**
For CHROs and HR leaders at mid-market to enterprise companies who need to understand workforce trends, Visier is an HR analytics platform that provides workforce intelligence powered by a proprietary benchmarking dataset. Unlike general BI tools, Visier is purpose-built for HR with pre-built metrics and benchmarking built in.

**Visier (with free tier — new signal):**
Their new positioning appears to be extending down-market: "Start with free, grow with Visier." This is a classic PLG (product-led growth) expansion — the positioning is now inclusive of smaller companies with a clear upgrade path.

**Our Product (inferred from 200% NRR, 150 customers, strong retention):**
For HR leaders at growing companies (50-500 employees) who need actionable workforce intelligence without a dedicated analytics team, [Our Product] is an HR analytics platform that delivers time-to-value faster and with more hands-on support than enterprise tools. Unlike Visier, we're built for companies your size — not a watered-down enterprise product.

**The positioning gap we must close:** Visier is now claiming our territory ("for companies your size") with a free entry point. We need to own a position they cannot credibly claim with a freemium model: **depth of partnership and time-to-value for resource-constrained HR teams.**

### Message Architecture Analysis

| Level | Visier (Post-Raise) | Our Product |
|-------|--------------------|-----------:|
| **Category** | Workforce Intelligence Platform | HR Analytics for Growing Companies |
| **Differentiator** | Scale + benchmarking data + now: accessible pricing | Partnership-first, built for lean HR teams |
| **Value Proposition** | Hire, retain, and develop better with data | Turn your people data into decisions, without a data team |
| **Proof Points** | 50,000+ companies in benchmark dataset; Gartner Leader | 200% NRR; [X]-minute average time-to-first-insight; customer stories |

### Positioning Gaps and Opportunities

**Unclaimed positions (open for us to take):**
- "HR analytics with a human team behind it" — Visier's free tier, by definition, cannot offer white-glove support at scale. This is structurally uncapturable by their free tier model.
- "Built for your stage" — there's a real product insight here: analytics needs at 150 employees are categorically different from analytics needs at 2,000 employees. We can own this if we invest in segment-specific product experiences.
- "Your data, your benchmarks" — rather than relying on Visier's proprietary aggregate dataset, we could lean into customer-specific contextual benchmarking built around their industry and geography.

**Crowded positions (avoid):**
- "Comprehensive HR analytics" — every competitor claims this, it has lost meaning
- "Easy to use" — also claimed by everyone, not differentiated
- "Data-driven HR" — the category descriptor, not a positioning

**Emerging positions (watch and potentially move into):**
- "AI-powered workforce intelligence" — Visier's $125M is likely partially funding AI development; if we don't have a credible AI story in 12 months, this position becomes theirs entirely
- "HR analytics for the age of hybrid/distributed work" — workforce analytics needs have shifted materially post-2020; there may be an unclaimed position around distributed team analytics

**Vulnerable positions (Visier's claims we can attack):**
- "Free" — it's not really free, it's a trial with upgrade pressure. We can reframe this in sales conversations.
- "Benchmark data" — their benchmark is built on large enterprises; the benchmarks may not be relevant for companies with 150-500 employees

## Win/Loss Analysis

### Current Data Interpretation

The three downgrades in 30 days are the most important data point you have right now. Before building any strategy, you need to understand what actually happened in those three accounts.

### Recommended Win/Loss Interview Guide

**For the three downgraders (conduct this week, VP Product or CEO level):**

1. "Walk me through what happened — what triggered the decision to change your plan?"
2. "Did Visier's announcement play a role? Did you speak with a Visier rep?"
3. "What specifically did you feel you were getting less value from at your previous tier?"
4. "What would bring you back to the full product?"
5. "What are you not getting now that you'll need eventually?"

**For recent churns (last 6 months):**

1. "What problem were you trying to solve when you first bought [Our Product]?"
2. "What did you end up doing after churning? Which product, or back to manual?"
3. "Where did our product fall short for your situation?"
4. "Was pricing the primary driver, or something else?"
5. "Would you come back? Under what conditions?"

**For recent new business wins vs. Visier:**

1. "You evaluated Visier — what made you choose us?"
2. "What almost made you go with Visier instead?"
3. "What would we need to change for you to seriously consider Visier at renewal?"

### Analyzing Win/Loss Patterns (Hypotheses to Validate)

Based on the information available, here are the likely patterns to investigate:

| Pattern | Hypothesis | How to Validate |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Price-driven downgrade | Customers in budget pressure saw free tier as cost relief | Ask directly: "Was budget the primary driver?" |
| FOMO / sales pressure | Visier sales reps used the free tier announcement as a reason to call | Ask: "Did you receive outreach from Visier?" |
| Feature complacency | Customers aren't using the features they're paying for | Check feature usage data before the downgrade |
| Trust/brand | Visier's raise signals market validation, creating doubt about us | Ask: "Did Visier's funding news change how you think about them?" |
| Product gap | Visier is genuinely offering something our product doesn't | Ask: "What does Visier offer that we don't?" |

## Market Trend Identification

### Relevant Trends for Strategic Response

**Trend 1: Democratization of HR Analytics**

| Analysis Dimension | Assessment |
|-------------------|-----------|
| What is changing? | HR analytics is moving from enterprise-only to SMB-accessible; free tiers and PLG motions are accelerating this |
| Why now? | Cloud infrastructure costs dropped; AI reduces build cost; VC funding enables loss-leading free tiers |
| Who is affected? | Our core segment (50-500 employees) — both current customers and prospects |
| Timeline | Now — Visier's free tier is live |
| Implication for us | Pricing power in our segment will compress unless we can demonstrate superior ROI |
| What are competitors doing? | Visier is leading this trend; Culture Amp has had a freemium motion; others will follow |

**Strategic response:** Fast follow — we need a clear value-tier entry point within 60-90 days (not necessarily free, but right-priced for the segment).

**Trend 2: AI-Powered Workforce Intelligence**

| Analysis Dimension | Assessment |
|-------------------|-----------|
| What is changing? | Generative AI is being applied to HR analytics — natural language queries, automated insight generation, predictive attrition |
| Why now? | GPT-4 class models are production-ready; HR data is a natural fit for LLM-based summarization |
| Who is affected? | All segments, but especially mid-market where there's no analyst to interpret data |
| Timeline | 1-2 years to mainstream adoption in SMB HR tech |
| Implication for us | First to market with a credible AI layer for our segment could redefine the value equation |
| What are competitors doing? | Visier announced AI features at their last conference; Workday has AI roadmap; Culture Amp has basic AI suggestions |

**Strategic response:** Lead — this is the highest-leverage investment. An AI-powered natural language interface for HR analytics (ask a question, get an insight) is the kind of feature that makes "free tier" a red herring.

**Trend 3: HR + Finance Analytics Convergence**

| Analysis Dimension | Assessment |
|-------------------|-----------|
| What is changing? | CFOs are increasingly co-owners of workforce analytics; the HR/Finance boundary is blurring |
| Why now? | Labor is the largest cost line; CFOs want labor cost modeling, not just engagement metrics |
| Timeline | 2-3 years; already happening at enterprise, spreading to mid-market |
| Implication for us | Expanding into workforce financial planning (headcount costs, labor efficiency) creates a new buyer and increases ACVs |
| What are competitors doing? | Visier has workforce financial planning; we may have a gap here |

**Strategic response:** Monitor → Fast Follow. This is a 12-18 month roadmap consideration, not an immediate response.

## Complete Competitive Response Strategy

### The Strategic Logic

The three-downgrade signal is real, but it is not yet a crisis. A crisis is if you see this pattern in your next 15 accounts. The strategic logic is:

1. **Defend the base** — stop the bleeding through direct engagement and commercial flexibility with at-risk accounts
2. **Out-partner, don't out-price** — Visier cannot match a genuine partnership model at freemium economics; this is our structural advantage
3. **Close the product gap on AI** — if we ship an AI-powered analytics layer before Visier brings it fully to their free tier, we have a "better product" story
4. **Consider a value-tiered entry point** — not a free tier, but a right-sized entry product for sub-100 employee companies

### Phase 1: Defend (Days 1-30)

**Priority 1: Churn Risk Triage**

Segment all 150 accounts:
- Tier 1 (Critical Risk): Sub-500 employees, contract renewal within 90 days, low engagement score → Exec outreach within 5 business days
- Tier 2 (Moderate Risk): Sub-500 employees, renewal in 90-180 days → CSM proactive check-in within 10 business days
- Tier 3 (Low Risk): Deep product integration, active power users, recent expansion → Document as case studies and references

**Priority 2: Win/Loss Sprint**

- Interview the 3 downgraders this week (VP Product level)
- Interview 5 recent churns from the past 6 months
- Interview 5 recent wins where Visier was in the deal
- Synthesize findings by Day 14 → brief CEO on what's actually happening

**Priority 3: Sales Enablement — Counter-Positioning**

Build a one-page "Visier Free Tier Response" for your sales team:

*What Visier's free tier actually is:* A feature-limited entry point designed to grow into a full-price contract. [Include specific limitations once intelligence is gathered.]

*What we offer that the free tier doesn't:* [3 specific capabilities — validate against matrix above.]

*The risk framing:* "Free HR analytics from a VC-funded company means your team will invest time setting it up, your people data will be stored and processed by them, and in 12-18 months when they need to show ROI on their $125M raise, that 'free' tier will have meaningful upgrade pressure."

*The ROI story:* "[Customer name] at [company size] saved $X in retention costs / avoided $Y in bad hires / reduced HR team workload by Z hours per week using [Our Product]." — Have at least 3 of these ready.

### Phase 2: Differentiate (Days 30-90)

**Priority 1: AI Features Sprint**

Scope a 60-90 day sprint to ship a natural language query interface. This doesn't need to be perfect — it needs to be credibly better than nothing, which is where Visier's free tier starts. Specific deliverable: "Ask your workforce data a question in plain English, get a chart and narrative answer."

This single feature, shipped well, changes the competitive narrative from "we cost money, they're free" to "we have AI-powered analytics built for HR teams your size."

**Priority 2: Customer Success Differentiation**

Create a formal "HR Analytics Success Program" for your installed base:
- Quarterly business reviews (QBRs) for all accounts above a revenue threshold
- "First 90 Days" success program for all new customers
- Named CSM guaranteed for all accounts above $X ARR
- Monthly "HR Analytics Benchmarking" webinar for all customers — community building

This is explicitly what Visier cannot offer at free tier economics. Make it visible, make it a product feature, not just a service.

**Priority 3: Benchmark Data Investment**

Visier's key differentiation is their benchmarking dataset built on large enterprises. Build an alternative benchmark story:
- Partner with HR associations (SHRM, HR Tech Network) to build a peer benchmark dataset specifically for companies under 1,000 employees
- This is a dataset that is more relevant to our ICP than Visier's enterprise-skewed benchmarks
- This is also a moat — it takes years to build

### Phase 3: Decide and Invest (Days 90+)

Based on the data gathered in Phases 1 and 2:

**Decision Gate at Day 90:**

| Data Signal | Interpretation | Response |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| Win/loss shows price is primary driver in >60% of losses | Freemium / low-price tier is necessary | Build free tier for sub-100 employees |
| Win/loss shows product gap (specific features) | Product investment is the lever | Accelerate roadmap on gap areas |
| Win/loss shows brand/trust deficit | Marketing and reference investment needed | Customer case study program + analyst briefings |
| Win/loss shows Visier sales motion is primary driver | Sales counter-intelligence needed | Train sales on specific Visier objection handling |

**If freemium is justified:** Build a genuine free tier for sub-100 employee companies that includes core reporting but excludes predictive analytics, custom integrations, and CSM. The free tier's job is to get companies using your product so they're already embedded when they grow past 100 employees — competing with Visier's land-and-expand with your own.

## What to Put on Your CEO's Desk Monday

### The One-Page Summary

**Situation:** Visier raised $125M and launched a free tier targeting our core segment (sub-500 employees). We're seeing early churn signals: 3 downgrades in 30 days.

**What we don't yet know (and need to find out this week):**
1. What specifically drove the 3 downgrades — price, product, or Visier's sales motion?
2. What Visier's free tier actually includes vs. excludes
3. Which of our 150 accounts are genuinely at risk

**What we know:** Our 200% NRR reflects real value delivery. Our structural advantage is partnership depth, not price. Visier cannot offer white-glove customer success at freemium economics.

**The 30-day plan:** Triage + learn. Assign coverage to at-risk accounts, interview downgraders and churns, gather competitive intelligence, build counter-positioning for sales team.

**The 90-day decision:** Based on data gathered, decide on freemium yes/no and AI feature sprint scope.

**What this costs:** X engineering hours (AI sprint), Y CSM hours (risk triage), Z in commercial concessions (at-risk account retention). CEO approval needed on commercial flexibility policy before any concessions are made.

**What we're NOT doing:** Panicking. Discounting at scale. Announcing a free tier we can't deliver.
