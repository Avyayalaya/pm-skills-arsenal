## The Honest Assessment: Your Moat Is Thinner Than You Think, But Not Unfixable

Let me give you the unvarnished view, then tell you what to actually do about it.

## How Strong Is Your Moat, Really?

At $8M ARR with 50 enterprise customers, you have a business — but the moat assessment depends on *why* customers stay, not just that they do.

### What's Working in Your Favor

**Customer switching costs are real but uneven.** Identity verification isn't a widget you swap out on a Tuesday. Your customers have integrated your SDK into their onboarding flows, trained their ops teams on your decision interface, and built their compliance documentation around your outputs. That integration debt is genuinely painful to unwind. The question is: how deep does that integration go at your specific 50 accounts? If most are doing a shallow API call to check a box, switching costs are lower than you think. If your product is embedded in their core user journey with custom rules, escalation workflows, and 18 months of accumulated verification history, you have real stickiness.

**Compliance and regulatory familiarity.** In identity verification, enterprise customers get very nervous about change. Switching vendors means re-validating a new system against their compliance requirements, re-training staff, potentially explaining a vendor change to regulators or auditors. This inertia works for incumbents — including you.

**Relationship capital at 50 accounts.** At this scale, you likely have real human relationships with the compliance leads, product owners, or operations managers at each account. That matters more than most founders admit. People don't rip out a vendor whose account team they trust and who responds on weekends.

### What's Working Against You

**You're not the only one with switching costs.** Jumio, Onfido, and Persona all have these same structural advantages against each other. Switching costs are table stakes in this market, not a differentiator.

**Brand and scale gaps are significant.** Jumio in particular has been in enterprise identity since before most of your team graduated. That brand recognition in procurement processes, in Gartner Magic Quadrants, in the "safe choice" conversations that happen in enterprise security reviews — that's real moat you don't have yet. When a Fortune 500 CISO is picking an identity vendor, "we went with Jumio" is a defensible career choice. "We went with [your company name]" requires more justification.

**Onfido and Persona are smart, well-funded, and not standing still.** Onfido has solid European regulatory depth and ML infrastructure. Persona has built an impressively composable platform that has attracted a vocal developer community. Neither is standing still.

**Data advantage is asymptotic and probably not yours.** Identity verification models improve with data volume — more documents verified = better accuracy. Jumio has processed hundreds of millions of verifications. You have not. The ML accuracy gap is real, even if it's narrowed significantly with modern foundation models and transfer learning.

## The Stripe Announcement: What It Actually Means

Here's the nuanced read: Stripe entering identity verification is a signal, not an immediate threat — but you need to think about it structurally, not just reactively.

**Stripe's actual target is Stripe customers.** Stripe Identity will initially be trivially easy to adopt for any company already using Stripe for payments. That's a massive distribution advantage for a specific segment: the high-growth tech companies doing online verification as part of a payment or fintech flow. This is probably not your current 50 enterprise customers (who are likely doing verification for employee onboarding, financial services KYC, healthcare access, or insurance claims — use cases that aren't core Stripe territory). But it may be the next 50 companies you were planning to sell to.

**Stripe will commoditize the basic flow.** Document capture + liveness check + name/address match — the baseline identity verification flow — will become a commodity item embedded in the Stripe dashboard. If any significant portion of your pipeline is companies doing basic onboarding verification as part of a payment context, Stripe just made your sales motion harder. Prospects in that segment will now ask "why not just use what we already have in Stripe?"

**What Stripe won't do well (at least for a while):**
- Complex, multi-step KYC with manual review escalation
- Regulated industry compliance depth (banking, healthcare, insurance, cannabis, gaming)
- High-volume cross-border document verification with regional coverage
- Customizable risk rules and fraud model tuning
- The professional services and implementation support that enterprise buyers often need
- White-label or deeply branded verification flows

**The strategic risk is longer-term.** Stripe has an extraordinary distribution flywheel and engineering talent. In 3-5 years, they will likely have a far more sophisticated identity product than what they launched with. The companies you want to land in the next 18 months may end up defaulting to Stripe identity when they're startups, making them much harder to displace when they become enterprises.

## What You Should Do: Near-Term (Next 90 Days)

### 1. Immediately Map Your Moat at the Account Level

Don't theorize about aggregate switching costs. Go account by account for your top 30 customers:
- How deep is our integration? (API call vs. embedded workflow vs. system of record for decisions)
- What would it actually cost them in time and money to switch?
- Who is the internal champion? Is that person still there?
- Are they evaluating Stripe, Jumio, or anyone else at renewal?

This gives you a real picture of where you're strong vs. vulnerable, not a guess.

### 2. Run Honest Win/Loss on Recent Deals

Pull the last 20 competitive deals — wins and losses. Get on calls with the buyers (not your sales reps — buyers directly). Find out:
- What alternatives they considered and why they chose/didn't choose them
- What almost made them go somewhere else
- What your actual differentiation was in their decision

Most companies think they know why they win. They're usually wrong. Your sales team's CRM notes are narrative post-rationalizations. Talk to buyers.

### 3. Get Clear on Which Use Case You Actually Win

You probably don't win everywhere equally. There is likely a segment or use case where you are disproportionately strong — a specific industry (fintech KYC, insurance, healthcare), a specific buyer type (compliance officer vs. CPO), or a specific technical need (high-volume async processing, specific regional document coverage, unusual fraud signals). Find that and name it explicitly. Your differentiation story needs to be concrete, not "we're the flexible, accurate, enterprise-ready platform."

### 4. Accelerate Depth in Your Strongest Vertical

Stripe's entry makes the generic identity verification market more crowded at the bottom. The companies that will survive are the ones with genuine depth in a domain where "good enough" is not good enough. Pick your best vertical — likely a regulated industry — and go deep. That means:
- Regulatory compliance documentation for that industry
- Reference customers who will talk specifically about that use case
- Integrations with the 3-4 systems that matter in that vertical's stack
- Possibly a dedicated customer success motion for that segment

This is the move that makes Stripe's generic offering irrelevant to your target buyer.

## Medium-Term (3-12 Months)

### Build a Switching Cost That Compounds

Your current switching costs are integration-based — once someone builds on a different platform, they won't switch back easily. But you want switching costs that *grow* with usage, not just exist at deployment. Consider:

- **Decision history and analytics.** If every identity check creates a data asset for the customer — patterns over time, fraud signal history, cohort analytics — leaving means losing that intelligence. Make the data increasingly theirs but only accessible through your platform.
- **Custom model tuning.** If customers can train their own risk rules and thresholds on top of your base model, their model becomes a unique asset. That's not portable to Stripe or Jumio.
- **Workflow and ops integration.** Embed into the systems where their operations team lives — Salesforce, ServiceNow, Zendesk — so your verification decisions are contextual to their existing workflow, not a separate system.

### Address the Data Moat Directly

You probably can't out-data Jumio on raw volume. But you can build a specific data advantage: proprietary signals for specific fraud patterns in specific verticals, or coverage depth for specific regions or document types your competition ignores. Identify 2-3 specific accuracy or coverage wins you can claim that are measurable and that matter to your target buyers.

### Raise Your Brand Visibility in the Buying Process

Enterprise identity purchases involve security reviews, compliance teams, and sometimes external audits. You need to be in those conversations: Gartner and Forrester coverage, SOC2 and relevant certifications front and center, case studies written for compliance and security audiences (not just product audiences), and analyst relationships that get you into shortlists.

## What You Should NOT Do

- **Do not try to out-feature Stripe.** They have more engineering resources than you. Feature parity with a platform player is not a winnable game.
- **Do not chase the broad SMB market.** Stripe will commoditize basic identity verification for tech SMBs. That segment is contested and will become low-margin. Your 50 enterprise customers paying enterprise prices are the business.
- **Do not panic-pivot.** The companies that survive platform competition are the ones with deep domain expertise and genuine customer relationships, not the ones who chased every shiny new direction.
- **Do not assume your 50 customers are safe just because they're integrated.** Renewal conversations are happening. Have them before your competition does.

## The Bottom Line

Your moat is real but not yet durable. You have integration stickiness and relationship capital — both of which are meaningful and worth protecting. You do not yet have the brand, scale, data, or vertical depth that would make you structurally advantaged against well-resourced competitors.

Stripe's entry is a forcing function, not a death sentence. It narrows the market you can address easily and speeds up the timeline to build real differentiation. The companies that will get hurt are the ones doing generic, horizontal identity verification with no particular depth. The companies that will be fine are the ones that can answer: "For [specific buyer, in specific industry, with specific compliance need], we are the only option that actually works."

Go build that answer, and build it fast.
