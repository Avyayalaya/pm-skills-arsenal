## Go/No-Go: Entering the Developer API Market for AI-Powered Document Processing

**Bottom line up front: Conditional GO — but only if you immediately narrow your target to a specific vertical and resist the gravitational pull of competing with cloud giants on their terms.**

Here is how I would think through this decision if I were sitting across from you.

### The Surface Reading of the Competitive Landscape Is Wrong

When most people look at this market, they see AWS Textract, Google Document AI, and Azure Form Recognizer and conclude: "Too crowded, too well-funded, too much distribution." That reading is superficially right and strategically useless.

The cloud giants are not building document AI to win document AI — they are building it to keep developers inside their ecosystems. Textract exists because without it, an AWS customer running their document workflow might route that workload to a Google Cloud service. These products are retention and cross-sell tools bundled into cloud suites. They are not being optimized to be the best document AI on the market; they are being optimized to be "good enough that you don't leave AWS."

This matters a lot for you. It means:

1. **Their pricing model is not yours.** They can afford to underprice the capability because document processing fees are a rounding error on cloud infrastructure revenue. You cannot win a price war with them. But you also do not need to.

2. **Their product roadmap serves different masters.** A PM at AWS Textract is fighting for resources against S3, EC2, and Bedrock. A product improvement that takes 6 months of eng time and moves document AI NPS by 5 points is not getting prioritized. Your 10-person team with deep NLP expertise can out-iterate them in the specific capabilities that matter to a specific customer segment.

3. **They do not own their customers' loyalty in this space.** Developers who use Textract are not evangelists — they're pragmatists who chose the path of least resistance. There is no Textract community. There is no developer who says "I love Textract." This is a moat gap you can exploit.

### The Verticals Are More Dangerous Than the Cloud Giants

Rossum and Instabase worry me more than AWS for your situation. Here is why:

**Rossum** has found genuine product-market fit in AP/AR document automation. They have customers who are operationally dependent on their extraction, who have trained models on their specific invoice formats, and who have finance workflows wired to their outputs. That is a real switching cost. You cannot easily displace them from their installed base.

**Instabase** has pursued a platform approach — document understanding as a development platform for enterprises to build their own workflows. They have funding, enterprise relationships, and a head start on the "build your own document AI application" thesis.

If your go-to-market says "we do everything these players do, but better," you will lose. These companies have 18-36 months of compounding on you in their chosen niches.

But here is the thing about vertical players: their competitive position is also their limitation. Rossum wins in AP/AR. Instabase wins in regulated industries with complex workflow requirements. Neither of them is the go-to solution for, say, legal document analysis at mid-market law firms, or insurance claims processing at regional carriers, or clinical trial data extraction for CROs. The verticals are carved up, not fully occupied.

### What Your Assets Actually Are

You have $5M, 10 people with deep NLP expertise, and one enterprise pilot customer. Let me be direct about what that means:

**$5M is 18-24 months of runway at a lean burn rate for a 10-person team.** You do not have the capital to build horizontal infrastructure to compete with cloud giants. You have enough to find and own a specific niche before running out of money.

**Deep NLP expertise is genuinely rare and relevant.** The cloud giants' document AI is built on general-purpose vision and language models fine-tuned on labeled data. It works well on common document types (structured invoices, standard forms) and degrades significantly on complex, semi-structured, or domain-specific documents. If your NLP depth lets you build meaningfully better understanding of complex documents in a specific domain — legal, medical, financial, technical — that is a real technical differentiation that a cloud giant will take 12-18 months to replicate even if they prioritize it.

**Your enterprise pilot customer is your most underrated asset.** Not because of the revenue, but because of what they tell you. The vertical they are in, the specific problem they hired you to solve, the documents they care about, the downstream systems they need to integrate with — this is your product roadmap, your initial ICP (ideal customer profile), and your first case study. Treat this customer as a co-development partner, not a revenue source.

### The Entry Strategy That Makes Sense

Given your constraints, here is the entry strategy I would pursue:

**1. Choose your vertical before writing another line of code.**

Your pilot customer has implicitly told you which vertical to enter. Go there. Do not try to be the horizontal document AI API for everyone — you will run out of money and runway before you build anything differentiated. Pick one vertical where:
- Documents are complex enough that cloud giants' general models underperform
- The market is large enough that 5-10 customers in year one gets you to a revenue base that justifies a Series A ($2-4M ARR at reasonable valuations)
- Your pilot customer's story is replicable — i.e., there are 50-200 companies with the exact same problem

**2. Go developer-first, enterprise-contract second.**

This market is won through developer love. The person who integrates your API into their company's document workflow is often a software engineer or data engineer, not a VP buying a solution. Make the API extraordinary to use — best-in-class documentation, generous free tier, Python and JavaScript SDKs that are genuinely well-designed, response times that do not require architectural workarounds. Developers who love your product are your best salespeople into enterprise contracts.

**3. Own a benchmark.**

Pick the document type and task where you are definitively better than every competitor. Publish the benchmark. Make it reproducible. Put the methodology on GitHub. This costs you almost nothing and establishes credibility with developers and early enterprise buyers who do their own technical evaluations. The cloud giants cannot do this transparently because showing a domain-specific benchmark where Textract underperforms is not in AWS's interest.

**4. Price for adoption, then for value.**

Your initial pricing should not optimize for revenue — it should optimize for getting 20-30 developers actively building on your API. At $5M seed funding, you have the runway to subsidize adoption. Once you have customers who depend on your accuracy for a business-critical workflow, you are in a position to price on outcomes (per-document, per-workflow, per-extraction) rather than on compute cost.

### The Specific Risks That Could Kill This

**Risk 1: You run the developer playbook for 18 months and sign 200 developers on the free tier but no enterprise contracts.**

This is the graveyard of developer-focused startups. Developer love does not automatically translate to enterprise revenue. From day one, you need to know which developers are building something their company will pay for, and be working those deals in parallel with your developer community growth. Your one enterprise pilot customer should be actively referring you to three more before the end of Q2.

**Risk 2: A cloud giant decides your vertical is worth owning and ships a specific solution in 9 months.**

If you pick a vertical large enough to matter (say, healthcare document processing at $1B+ TAM), Google or AWS could decide to compete directly. The defense is speed and depth: be so embedded in your customers' workflows, with so much domain-specific model training on their document types, that switching costs are real. The first 10 enterprise customers are not just revenue — they are moat-building.

**Risk 3: Your NLP expertise is in the wrong layer of the stack.**

LLMs are rapidly commoditizing document understanding at the "extract text and identify entities" level. If your NLP expertise is in transformer fine-tuning on labeled document datasets, that expertise may have a shorter shelf life than you expect as foundation model capabilities advance. You need to be honest about whether your technical differentiation is in a layer that is commoditizing or a layer that is getting more valuable.

**Risk 4: The enterprise pilot customer does not convert to a paying contract.**

If your one existing customer does not pay you real money (not a subsidized pilot) within the next 6 months, you have a product-market fit problem, not a go-to-market problem. Do not let a promising pilot substitute for the hard conversation about whether customers will actually pay for this.

### The No-Go Scenario

There is a version of this that is a clear no-go: if your plan is to build a general-purpose document AI API to compete across all the same use cases as Textract, Document AI, and Form Recognizer, and differentiate on "better accuracy and better developer experience," you will burn through $5M in 18 months and not build a durable business. The market has too many well-funded players, the cloud giants have too much distribution leverage, and "better for developers" is not a sustainable moat.

---

### The Go Scenario

But that is not the only path. If you enter with a specific vertical thesis, use your NLP expertise to build meaningfully superior extraction for complex document types in that vertical, and execute a developer-led motion that converts to enterprise contracts, you have a viable business. The market is large, the incumbents all have blind spots, and a focused team of 10 with real technical depth can outmaneuver the large players in a defined niche.

**My recommendation: GO — but only after you have written down your specific vertical, your specific customer archetype, the specific document type you are meaningfully better at, and why the cloud giants will not close that gap in the 18 months it takes you to establish your first 10 enterprise customers. If you cannot write that down clearly in 2 pages, keep working on the strategy before spending on engineering.**
