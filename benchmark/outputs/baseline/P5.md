## Competitive Strategy for a Vertical SaaS at the Crossroads

You're in a genuinely difficult but not uncommon situation: three simultaneous competitive threats hitting from three different directions at the same time your fundraising environment is tightening. The good news is that your 110% NRR tells you something important — the customers you have, you're keeping and expanding. That's your foundation. Everything else flows from defending and building on that.

Let me work through this clearly.

## What's Actually Happening to You

Before strategy, it helps to name the three very different attack vectors:

**Yardi (bundling from above):** Yardi isn't trying to beat you on product quality. They're trying to make your module a line item in a larger negotiation. When they acquire a reporting tool, they're offering procurement consolidation — "buy everything from us, it's simpler." Their target audience is your existing customers who already use Yardi for something else. This is an integration and sales displacement threat, not a feature threat.

**VTS (expansion into your core):** VTS is a well-capitalized competitor that has built real relationships with commercial real estate operators through leasing. They now have a beachhead in the asset management workflow adjacency. $300M raised means they can subsidize a move into your space, run at a loss to acquire customers, and out-spend you on sales and marketing. Their vector is relationship leverage — they already know your prospects.

**Lessen (disruption from below):** Lessen is playing a different game entirely. They're going after your lowest-paying, lowest-margin customers (sub-50 unit portfolios) with AI-native pricing you can't match without fundamentally changing your cost structure. This is classic low-end disruption. The right response isn't to fight them there — it's to let them have that segment while you move up-market and fortify your position with customers who need what only you provide.

**The funding environment:** This is real and worth taking seriously. PropTech VC funding down 60% means your Series B will require either demonstrated path to profitability, a compelling strategic narrative that's differentiated from every other "AI-enabled PropTech" story, or a strategic partner/acquirer conversation. Your 22-month CAC payback means you're not capital-efficient enough to raise on metrics alone right now.

## The Core Strategic Question You Have to Answer First

Before tactics, you need to decide: are you building an independent company to Series B and beyond, or are you building a company that's a strategic acquisition target for a major player?

These are different strategies. Here's why it matters:

If you're building to be acquired or partnered, you should double down on depth in your core asset management capabilities, protect your most differentiated features, make your data model and customer relationships acquisition-attractive, and have active conversations with potential acquirers now (not after you desperately need money).

If you're building to independence, you need a path to either (a) capital efficiency — get CAC payback under 15 months by focusing sales on your highest-converting, highest-NRR segments — or (b) a growth story that justifies the harder raise.

My honest read: given where you are right now (45% growth, 22-month CAC payback, three simultaneous competitive threats, tight funding market), the most value-creating path is probably to have both conversations in parallel rather than committing to one. The board wants either/or; the right answer may be to pursue the independent path while actively creating M&A optionality.

## Where to Play

**Go deep in mid-market commercial real estate operators (50–500 unit portfolios) with complex multi-asset, multi-investor structures.** This is the segment Lessen can't serve (too complex for their AI-automation model), Yardi over-serves with expensive legacy infrastructure, and VTS hasn't yet built for. This is your defensible territory.

Specifically:
- Multi-asset portfolio operators who need consolidated reporting across asset classes
- Firms with complex investor reporting requirements (LP reporting, waterfall calculations, fund-level views)
- Operators with a mix of asset types (office, industrial, multifamily) that Yardi's siloed modules handle poorly

**Abandon the sub-50 unit SMB segment intentionally.** You cannot compete with Lessen on price in that segment. They have AI-native cost structures and VC subsidizing customer acquisition. You will burn sales and marketing budget chasing customers with low ACV and high churn risk. Let that segment go. This is a hard decision but it frees up resources.

**Be selective about enterprise.** Yardi owns large enterprise. Don't try to displace them in a 10,000-unit REIT. Do try to win the $500M AUM independent sponsors and fund managers who find Yardi too slow, too expensive, and too rigid.

## How to Win

**Your moat is depth on investor-facing workflows.** Yardi was built for property operations — rent rolls, maintenance, accounting. VTS was built for leasing. Neither has built truly excellent investor reporting, LP portal experiences, waterfall calculations, and fund-level analytics. This is your differentiation. Double down here.

**Make switching costs structural, not contractual.** The customers who stay and expand (your 110% NRR) are almost certainly ones where your product is embedded in their investor reporting workflows, their LP communications, and their fund documents. That's sticky. Deepen those integrations. Make it so that moving away means rebuilding years of investor reporting history and re-onboarding LPs to a new portal. Contractual switching costs erode; data and workflow switching costs compound over time.

**Build the integration moat Yardi is trying to commoditize.** Yardi's bundling strategy only works if they can cover enough of your customer's workflow. If you build superior integrations with the tools your customers actually use — accounting systems like Yardi itself, Buildium, AppFolio, but also Argus for valuations, Juniper Square or Equity Multiple for fund management, data providers like CoStar — you become a connective tissue that's hard to replace even if Yardi offers a mediocre version of your feature.

**Use AI strategically, not defensively.** You can't match Lessen's AI-automation pricing. But you can use AI to improve the workflows of your mid-market customers in ways that are genuinely complex — automated variance commentary in investor reports, AI-driven NOI forecasting with asset-specific assumptions, natural language queries against portfolio data. These are high-value applications your target customer segment will pay for. AI as a premium value-add, not AI as a cost-reduction race to the bottom.

**Sales efficiency over sales volume.** Your CAC is rising 40% YoY. The fastest path to improving unit economics is not cutting marketing spend but improving sales efficiency: better ICP definition, shorter sales cycles, higher-converting demos, faster time-to-value in onboarding. Every month you reduce CAC payback, the Series B story improves.

## What to Stop Doing

**Stop selling to sub-50 unit operators.** You're spending real sales energy on customers who will either churn to Lessen or drag down your unit economics. The LTV probably doesn't justify the CAC at that segment. Set a minimum deal size that reflects a customer profile where you can actually win and retain.

**Stop competing on features against Yardi's bundle.** If a prospect is choosing between you as a best-of-breed module and Yardi as an integrated bundle, you will lose on price and integration friction. Don't have that conversation. Compete on outcomes: "Companies that use our investor reporting module expand their LP base 30% faster" is better than "we have these 15 features Yardi doesn't."

**Stop trying to be horizontal.** The instinct in a competitive squeeze is to add features and expand the platform to be harder to replace. That instinct is usually wrong at your stage. Depth in a defensible niche beats breadth that spreads your engineering across surface area you can't defend.

**Stop waiting on the partnership conversation.** If M&A or strategic partnership is on the table, start those conversations now. A strategic partnership with a title company, a debt capital markets firm, or a real estate data provider could give you distribution, data advantages, or both. An acqui-hire conversation with Juniper Square, Altus Group, or even a PE-backed rollup of PropTech companies could be worth exploring. These conversations take 6-18 months; starting them now gives you optionality at your Series B.

## How to Frame This for the Board

The board wants either an accelerated growth path or a strategic conversation. Here's the honest framing:

**The accelerated growth path** requires a deliberate segment retreat (abandon SMB to Lessen), a doubling-down on investor-facing workflow depth, and a sales efficiency program to get CAC payback under 15 months. This gets you to a fundable Series B story in 12-18 months IF the competitive pressure from VTS doesn't accelerate faster than expected. The risk is VTS moves into your mid-market sweet spot before you've fortified it.

**The strategic conversation** is worth pursuing in parallel regardless. Your 110% NRR, 200 customers with real data histories, and a defensible position in commercial real estate asset management workflows makes you a genuinely attractive acquisition target for:
- Real estate data and analytics providers (CoStar, Altus Group)
- Fund administration platforms expanding into real estate (Juniper Square, Yardi itself, Addepar)
- PE firms rolling up PropTech software businesses
- Title companies or commercial real estate services firms wanting software-enabled relationships

The board framing I'd recommend: "We are executing a dual-track strategy. Track 1 is operational — we are tightening ICP to mid-market, exiting SMB, deepening investor-reporting moat, and improving CAC payback to Series B-fundable metrics. Track 2 is strategic — we are actively exploring partnership and M&A conversations where we can deliver more value to customers faster than we could independently. Both tracks are real. We'll know within 6 months which track yields the better outcome for shareholders."

## 90-Day Priorities

1. **Segment audit:** Analyze your 200 customers by segment (SMB vs. mid-market), ACV, NRR, and competitor overlap. Quantify what you'd lose by stopping SMB sales and what you'd gain in sales efficiency. This is the data for the ICP tightening decision.

2. **Win/loss review:** Pull the last 20 competitive deals (wins and losses). Understand where VTS is actually showing up, what feature gaps they're winning on, and whether they're undercutting on price or winning on relationship. This defines what needs to be built vs. what's a sales/positioning fix.

3. **Strategic partnership outreach:** Identify 5-8 potential acquirers/strategic partners and initiate conversations with 2-3 of them before the board meeting. You don't need a term sheet — you need to know whether interest is real.

4. **Investor reporting product sprint:** Ship one meaningful improvement to your investor reporting/LP experience that your target segment will notice. This is both a retention play and a demo-able differentiator for Series B conversations.

5. **Series B narrative draft:** Write the 15-slide deck now. The act of writing it will force clarity on which strategy you're pursuing. Share it with 2-3 friendly investors for feedback before the board meeting.

## The Honest Synthesis

You are in a competitive squeeze, but you're not in a death spiral. 110% NRR means your product works for the customers who need it. The question is whether you can defend and expand that position before VTS crosses into your territory with $300M behind them.

The answer is probably: not by competing with VTS across the board. But by being so deeply embedded in investor-facing workflows for mid-market operators — LP portals, waterfall calculations, fund-level reporting, multi-asset analytics — that VTS's leasing-first product can't displace you even if they try. That's a defensible position. Build it, price it to reflect its value, and tell that story to your Series B investors.

If you do those things and the competitive dynamics still make independent scaling difficult, you'll have built an even more attractive acquisition target in the process. The dual-track isn't a fallback — it's the rational strategy for your situation.
