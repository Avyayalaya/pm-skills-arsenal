## Competitive Response Strategy: Visier Free Tier Threat

**Context:** You're VP Product at an HR analytics platform with $30M ARR, 200% NRR, 150 customers. You're #2 in the market. Visier just raised $125M and launched a free tier targeting sub-500 employee companies — your core segment. Three customers downgraded in the last 30 days. You need a plan for your CEO by Monday.

## The Honest Assessment First

Before jumping to tactics, you need to be clear-eyed about what's actually happening. Visier didn't launch a free tier because they want to give charity to small businesses. They raised $125M and they're executing a land-and-expand playbook: get into companies at zero cost, build switching costs through data history and workflow integration, then upsell as those companies grow. The three downgrades you're seeing are an early warning signal, not the main event. The main event is the pipeline of deals you won't even know you're losing over the next 6-12 months.

Here's the core tension you need to resolve before building any strategy: **Can you match a free tier without destroying your economics?** If your unit economics allow it, you fight on price. If they don't, you need to win on a different dimension entirely. This document assumes your margins can't sustain a full free tier at Visier's scale — if that assumption is wrong, update accordingly.

## Immediate Actions (This Week)

### 1. Stop the Bleeding — The Three Downgraders

Do not let these become churns. Call them personally — not a CSM, you or your CEO. Find out what specifically drove the downgrade:
- Was it a Visier sales rep in their ear? If so, what was the pitch?
- Was it a budget constraint that Visier's free tier conveniently solved?
- Were they already unhappy with something?

The answers tell you whether this is a price problem, a product problem, or a Visier sales motion problem. Each requires a different response. Offer a temporary commercial accommodation to keep them on your standard tier while you assess — losing them to a downgrade today often means losing them to a churn in 90 days.

### 2. Build Your Churn Risk Map

Go through all 150 customers and score each one on:
- **Segment match:** How squarely do they fall in the sub-500 employee target Visier is going after?
- **Engagement depth:** Are they deeply embedded (heavy API usage, custom integrations, long data history) or are they light users?
- **Relationship quality:** Do you have a champion who will fight for you internally, or is the relationship transactional?
- **Contract timing:** Who's up for renewal in the next 90 days?

Rank your top 20 highest-risk accounts and assign an exec or senior CSM to each one. These people need a proactive outreach call within 5 business days — not to pitch them, but to listen.

### 3. Gather Competitive Intelligence

You need real intelligence on what Visier's free tier actually offers:
- What features are included vs. gated?
- What are the upgrade triggers?
- What are the actual limitations (user count, data volume, integrations)?
- What's the upsell path look like?

This tells you the real competitive surface area. A free tier that includes your core differentiating features is an existential threat. A free tier that's genuinely crippled (no integrations, no historical data) is a lead-gen tool, not a product. Those require very different responses.

## The Strategic Choices (What Goes to Your CEO)

You have four strategic options. I'm going to lay them out honestly, including the risks of each.

### Option 1: Compete on Price — Launch Your Own Free/Freemium Tier

**The play:** Launch a free tier for sub-200 employees (staying slightly above Visier's entry point) or a freemium model with meaningful functionality.

**Why it could work:** You eliminate the price advantage, you stay in deals you're currently losing before they even start, and you build your own land-and-expand motion.

**The real risks:**
- If your cost structure doesn't support free users, you accelerate losses.
- You commoditize your own product in the market's perception.
- You may not be able to execute a proper freemium motion quickly enough to matter — a half-built free tier can actually hurt conversion.
- Visier has $125M; if this becomes a race to the bottom, they have more runway to sustain losses.

**When to choose this:** If your gross margins are 70%+ and you have the engineering capacity to build a genuinely good free tier in 60 days.

### Option 2: Compete on Value — Widen the Product Gap

**The play:** Don't match price. Instead, make your product so clearly superior for your segment that the price difference becomes irrelevant. Accelerate roadmap investment in the 2-3 features where you're already ahead or where Visier has known gaps.

**Why it could work:** 200% NRR tells you your existing customers find enormous value in your product. Double down on what's driving that expansion revenue. If you can articulate a clear ROI story — "our platform saved this 300-person company $400K in turnover costs" — free vs. paid becomes a different conversation.

**The real risks:**
- This is a medium-term play. It doesn't stop the near-term churn signals.
- If Visier's free tier is good enough to satisfy your segment's core needs, you can't product-develop your way out of free.
- You need to know specifically where your product is ahead — and be honest about whether those advantages matter to your customers.

**When to choose this:** If you have 2-3 features where you're genuinely differentiated and your customers consistently reference them in expansion conversations.

### Option 3: Compete on Segment — Move Upmarket

**The play:** Deliberately shift your ICP to 500-2,000 employee companies (mid-market) where Visier's free tier doesn't apply and where your 200% NRR and product depth are a bigger advantage.

**Why it could work:** You get out of the fight entirely. Mid-market HR analytics is often underserved — the big enterprise tools are too complex and expensive, and the SMB tools are too limited. You have the product depth to serve it.

**The real risks:**
- This takes 12-18 months minimum to execute — sales motion, marketing, customer success all have to shift.
- You may abandon your existing segment before you've established yourself in the new one.
- Mid-market has its own competitive dynamics you need to understand first.

**When to choose this:** If your product already has several mid-market customers who expanded into it, or if your data shows mid-market companies evaluating you and losing to Visier's enterprise product (not free tier).

### Option 4: Counter-Position — Make Visier's Free Tier a Risk

**The play:** Instead of fighting the free tier directly, reframe it as a risk. Build messaging and sales tools around: data portability concerns ("what happens to your people data when you're locked into a free tier?"), implementation risk ("free tiers typically lack the support you need to get value"), and the "VC-funded free tier" risk ("when Visier needs to monetize, that free tier becomes very expensive").

**Why it could work:** Enterprise buyers and even mid-market HR leaders are risk-averse. "Free" from a VC-funded company with an explicit upsell motion is not the same as "value." You can make this case credibly.

**The real risks:**
- This is a delay tactic, not a strategy. You need to pair it with something else.
- If Visier's free tier is genuinely good and their upsell path is fair, this messaging looks defensive and hollow.
- You need sales enablement done well — a ham-fisted "Visier is dangerous" pitch backfires.

**When to choose this:** Always, as a component of any other option.

## My Recommended Path: Option 2 + 4, With Option 1 as a Hedge

Here's what I'd actually put in front of the CEO:

**Phase 1 (0-30 days): Protect and Learn**
- Complete the churn risk map, assign coverage to top 20 at-risk accounts
- Conduct win/loss interviews with the three downgraders and 5-10 recent churns/at-risk accounts
- Complete intelligence gathering on Visier's free tier
- Build counter-positioning messaging for the sales team
- Hold a customer advisory board session (virtual) with 8-10 of your strongest advocates to co-create your response

**Phase 2 (30-90 days): Sharpen Your Edge**
- Based on intelligence gathered, identify your top 2-3 product differentiators that Visier's free tier doesn't cover
- Accelerate those on the roadmap — ship something visible in 60-90 days
- Build ROI calculators and case studies that quantify the value you deliver (this is what makes a $X/month vs. free conversation winnable)
- Launch a "startup package" at discounted pricing for sub-100 employee companies who are genuinely price-sensitive — this is not a free tier, it's a value-tiered entry point

**Phase 3 (90+ days): Decide on Freemium**
- By day 90, you'll have data: are you winning or losing on product, on price, or on both?
- If the data says price is the primary barrier, you now have the evidence to justify a free tier investment to your board
- If the data says product, double down on Phase 2

**What the CEO needs to hear Monday:**
1. The three downgrades are real signals we're taking seriously — here's our immediate response
2. We're not panicking, and we're not doing nothing
3. Here's the 30-day plan to stop the bleeding and gather real intelligence
4. Here's the decision we'll need to make at day 30 (freemium yes/no) with the criteria we'll use
5. Here's what this costs: X engineering hours, Y CS hours, Z in commercial concessions

## What You Should NOT Do

- **Do not announce a free tier in response to Visier's free tier without a working product.** Empty announcements alert Visier and don't help customers.
- **Do not discount your way out of this at scale.** Three discounts to at-risk accounts is tactical. Dropping your ASP across the board destroys your ARR without winning the underlying fight.
- **Do not assume your 200% NRR shields you.** NRR tells you your existing customers love you. It says nothing about your ability to acquire new customers in the new competitive environment.
- **Do not let this distract from new business.** The instinct in a competitive crisis is to focus entirely on defense. You still need to close new deals — and your new business pipeline is probably being affected too.

---

## The Question Your CEO Will Ask That You Need to Answer

"If we do nothing differently, what does our ARR look like in 12 months?"

Build this model before Monday: take your current logo base, segment by Visier's target (sub-500 employees), estimate churn risk by engagement depth, and project the ARR impact. If the answer is "we lose $3-5M ARR in the next 12 months," that's the burning platform that justifies aggressive investment. If the answer is "we lose $500K," the response is more measured.

The 200% NRR is your strongest asset and your potential blind spot. It reflects your installed base. The competitive battle is being fought in your next 50 customers, not your current 150.

---

## One More Thing

The $125M Visier just raised isn't going entirely into the free tier. It's going into:
- Enterprise sales team expansion (moving up-market)
- International expansion
- Product depth in areas they're currently weak

That means in 18-24 months, Visier will be competing harder for the same mid-market companies you might try to move upmarket to acquire. Whatever strategy you choose, the clock is running. The time to build your next layer of defensibility is now, not after the churn materializes.

Good luck Monday.
