## Executive Summary

**Five sentences a VP can act on:**

Asana, Monday.com, and Notion all hold durable power in the general PM market but share a structural blind spot: none was built around the campaign as a unit of work, and none has closed the loop between execution and marketing outcomes. The market is in early-majority transition for horizontal PM tools but remains pre-chasm for marketing-vertical PM — meaning the whole product for marketing teams has not yet been delivered by any player, and the segment is waiting for a credible reference customer to trust. Monday.com's Work OS platform play makes them the most dangerous long-term aggregator threat, not because their marketing product is best, but because they are commoditizing the project management layer from above as a bundled feature of a broader platform. The most immediate and defensible counter-position is to build the campaign lifecycle as a structured first-class workflow (brief → execution → assets → launch → retrospective → reporting), then use marketing-specific integrations (HubSpot, GA4, Ads platforms) to create customer-created switching costs that no incumbent currently possesses. **Decision: Enter the market as the marketing-vertical PM tool with a self-serve motion targeting content and demand gen teams of 5-30 people; resist platform expansion until you hold 50%+ NPS lead over Asana in this segment and have a reference base that can cross the chasm into early majority marketing teams.**

## Part 1: Competitive Set Definition

### Primary Competitors (Full Analysis)

| Competitor | Why Primary | Market Signal |
|---|---|---|
| **Asana** | Same category; directly evaluated against any PM tool for marketing | Appears in >60% of G2 "marketing project management" comparisons [Tier 4: G2 category data] |
| **Monday.com** | Same category; dedicated Monday Marketing vertical product | Fastest-growing large-cap PM tool 2022-2024; Monday Marketing launched 2022 [Tier 5: company press releases] |
| **Notion** | Same category; most common self-serve alternative for marketing teams at startups | 35M+ users; >40% growth YoY 2022-2023 [Tier 5: Notion PR]; most-mentioned tool in "replacing PM tools" discussions |

### Secondary Competitors (Adjacency Scan)

| Competitor | Expansion Vector | Timeline to Direct Competition |
|---|---|---|
| **HubSpot** | Already owns the marketing workflow; a Projects module is logical given CRM + Campaigns + Marketing Hub already in market | 12-24 months — HubSpot's 2024 product expansion signals platform consolidation intent [Tier 5: HubSpot Inbound 2024 keynote] |
| **Canva** | Owns creative production; adding task assignment, approval routing, and campaign calendaring would keep marketing teams inside Canva | 18-36 months — Canva Teams features already include basic assignment [Tier 1: product data] |
| **Airtable** | Already used as a campaign tracker by many marketing teams; Interface Designer creates a near-PM product | Now — already in evaluations in lower-market segments |
| **ClickUp** | Aggressive pricing and features; explicitly targets Asana/Monday switchers; has marketing templates | Now in direct competition; lower price point is their weapon |

### Non-Obvious / Paradigm Threats

| Threat | Mechanism | Probability | Leading Indicator |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AI-native "marketing copilot"** (e.g., a tool built around AI generating campaign plans, not humans tracking tasks) | Disrupts the entire project management model — instead of humans managing tasks, AI manages the campaign and humans review exceptions | 25% within 36 months | Watch: YC batch companies, a16z investments in "AI for marketing ops," Anthropic/OpenAI product direction |
| **CRM giants absorbing PM** (Salesforce/HubSpot building a full project management layer tied to campaigns) | Platform kill: PM becomes a feature of the marketing platform, not a standalone product | 35% within 24 months | Watch: HubSpot's project/task feature development; Salesforce Marketing Cloud roadmap |
| **Figma expanding into campaign coordination** | Figma owns the design handoff; if they add brief-to-launch coordination for creative campaigns, they intercept the top of your workflow | 15% within 36 months | Watch: FigJam feature launches, Figma acquisition activity |

## Part 2: 7 Powers Heat Map

**Scoring basis:** Tier 1-3 evidence where available; Tier 5 (company signals) for strategy direction. All ratings include accrual/erosion direction assessment.

| Power | Asana | Monday.com | Notion | Your Startup |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Scale Economies** | 🟢 Strong | 🟢 Strong | 🟡 Moderate | 🔴 Weak |
| **Network Effects** | 🟡 Ecosystem | 🟡 Platform NE | 🟡 Community | 🔴 None |
| **Counter-Positioning** | 🔴 None | 🔴 None | 🔴 None | 🟢 Marketing-vertical |
| **Switching Costs** | 🟢 Workflow/Data | 🟡 Workflow | 🟡 Identity/Data | 🔴 Nascent |
| **Branding** | 🟢 Enterprise trust | 🟡 Flexibility brand | 🟡 Knowledge worker | 🔴 Unknown |
| **Cornered Resource** | 🟡 Enterprise data | 🔴 None | 🔴 None | 🔴 None |
| **Process Power** | 🟢 Sales motion | 🟡 Product-led | 🔴 None | 🔴 None |

### Power-by-Power Analysis

**Scale Economies — Asana 🟢 (accruing), Monday 🟢 (accruing), Notion 🟡 (accruing), You 🔴**

Asana and Monday both benefit from infrastructure scale (hosting millions of users with near-zero marginal cost per additional user) and from data infrastructure that improves product quality (AI training data, behavioral insights). Asana's cost per seat has been declining as they scale, giving them pricing flexibility in mid-market deals that a startup cannot match. Your scale disadvantage is real and permanent in the near term — you cannot compete on cost. Counter-strategy: don't compete on cost; compete on fit. The marketing team that saves 3 hours/week on campaign coordination doesn't need you to be cheaper than Asana; they need you to be demonstrably better for their job.
[Tier 5: Asana 2024 earnings call — infrastructure investment signals; Tier 4: G2 pricing data]

**Network Effects — Asana 🟡 (moderate, ecosystem NE, partially eroding), Monday 🟡 (platform NE, accruing), Notion 🟡 (community NE, accruing), You 🔴**

None of these competitors has strong direct network effects — project management is not inherently social in the way Slack or LinkedIn is. Asana's network effects are ecosystem-driven (integrations with 300+ tools create a dependency web) — valuable but not self-reinforcing in the way true NE are. Monday.com's platform NE is more interesting: as more of a company's workflows move to Monday (CRM, Dev, Marketing), the cost of switching any one team increases because the platform loses coherence. This is a form of bundling NE, not product NE — but it is accruing. Notion's NE is community-driven (template ecosystem, public pages, cult following) — strong with knowledge workers and developers, less relevant for corporate marketing teams.

**Counter-Positioning — You 🟢 (if executed correctly)**

This is your most important Power and the only one available to you as a startup. Counter-positioning exists when you can adopt a position that the incumbents cannot copy without damaging their existing business. Three counter-positions are available:

1. **Marketing-vertical specialization**: Asana and Monday are horizontal. Going deep on marketing workflows requires them to either build a marketing-specific product that competes with their own horizontal positioning, or ignore you. Monday has already tried to solve this with Monday Marketing — but building it as a vertical on a horizontal platform creates internal prioritization conflicts and architectural constraints that a purpose-built product doesn't have.

2. **Campaign-outcome integration**: Building integrations with HubSpot, GA4, and Ads platforms to close the loop between execution and results. This is a counter-position because Asana and Monday have business reasons NOT to build deep marketing analytics integrations — they risk looking like they're competing with the marketing stack instead of integrating with it, and their horizontal PM identity would be diluted.

3. **Self-serve + no sales-led motion**: A fully product-led motion with transparent pricing and no enterprise sales at launch. Asana and Monday have both invested heavily in sales teams and cannot credibly tell enterprise procurement that they're abandoning that motion.

**Warning:** Counter-positioning is only durable if the incumbents genuinely cannot respond. Test each counter-position against: "What would Asana have to sacrifice to match this?" If the answer is "not much," it's not a real counter-position.

**Switching Costs — Asana 🟢 (strong, customer-created, accruing), Monday 🟡 (moderate, mixed), Notion 🟡 (identity + data), You 🔴 (nascent)**

See detailed switching cost decomposition in Part 3.

**Branding — Asana 🟢 (accruing at enterprise), Monday 🟡 (moderate, consolidating), Notion 🟡 (strong with target segment), You 🔴**

Asana's brand = "enterprise-trusted PM." This is a genuine branding power for mid-to-large companies where the procurement team needs a safe choice. For marketing teams specifically, Asana's brand is actually a liability — it signals "engineering/ops tool we were given" rather than "tool built for us." Notion's brand with knowledge workers and startup culture is genuine but is also a trap — being the "Notion for marketing" means you inherit Notion's associations (flexible, opinionated, slightly precious) which may not be what a serious marketing team wants. Target brand: "the PM tool marketing pros actually recommend" — built on community reviews, marketing team word of mouth, and G2 category ownership.

**Cornered Resource — Asana 🟡, Others 🔴**

Asana's most underrated cornered resource is their enterprise customer data — years of workflow and project data across thousands of companies that can be used to train AI features and benchmark performance. This is accruing. No other competitor has a cornered resource today. Your potential cornered resource: if you build marketing-outcome integrations (HubSpot, Ads) early and accumulate data on what campaign structures correlate with successful campaign performance, you could build a proprietary data asset over 24-36 months. This would be the most durable long-term moat available to you.

**Process Power — Asana 🟢 (sales motion, accruing), Monday 🟡**

Asana has built a sophisticated enterprise sales motion over 10+ years — SDR teams, CS playbooks, onboarding frameworks, customer success escalation structures. This is process power that cannot be replicated quickly. For you, process power at this stage = your onboarding process for marketing teams. Invest in a well-designed customer success motion specific to marketing team workflows — the PM who joins your product in month 1 and is running their first campaign in week 2 becomes a reference customer who recruits the next marketing PM. This is process power you can build.

**Decision Point from Heat Map:** No competitor holds more than 3 strong Powers in the marketing PM vertical (Asana holds Scale + Switching Costs + Brand + Process, but its Switching Costs and Brand are partially counteracted by poor marketing-specific fit). The market for marketing-vertical PM is **structurally contestable** — there is no unassailable incumbent in this specific niche. Your counter-positioning window is open, but it closes as Monday deepens Monday Marketing and as Asana adds marketing-specific AI.

## Part 3: Switching Cost Decomposition

### Asana Switching Cost Analysis

| Switching Cost Type | Asana | Monday.com | Notion | Your Target |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Financial/Contractual | ████████░░ 8/10 | ██████░░░░ 6/10 | ██░░░░░░░░ 2/10 | ██░░░░░░░░ 2/10 |
| Data/Migration | █████████░ 9/10 | ██████░░░░ 6/10 | █████░░░░░ 5/10 | ████░░░░░░ 4/10 |
| Workflow/Integration | █████████░ 9/10 | ███████░░░ 7/10 | ███░░░░░░░ 3/10 | ██████░░░░ 6/10 (target) |
| Identity/Social | ████████░░ 8/10 | █████░░░░░ 5/10 | █████████░ 9/10 | ███░░░░░░░ 3/10 |
| Learning/Procedural | ████████░░ 8/10 | █████░░░░░ 5/10 | █████░░░░░ 5/10 | ████░░░░░░ 4/10 |
| Relational/Trust | ███████░░░ 7/10 | ████░░░░░░ 4/10 | ████░░░░░░ 4/10 | ██░░░░░░░░ 2/10 |

**Key structural insight:** Asana's switching costs are primarily **customer-created** — the more a team uses Asana, the deeper the data, workflow rules, and integration dependencies accumulate. These are the most durable switching costs because they grow with usage and cannot be dissolved by a competitor offering to pay exit fees.

Monday.com's switching costs are meaningful but moderate — their workflow/integration costs are rising as the platform grows (CRM + PM + Dev on one platform means multiple teams' workflows are embedded). However, Monday's switching costs are vulnerable: if a marketing team was never using the CRM or Dev products, their Monday PM switching cost is low.

Notion's dominant switching cost is **identity** — "we're a Notion team" is a genuine cultural statement among startup and knowledge worker communities. This makes Notion extremely sticky for its core users, but it is a vendor-imposed cost (based on brand identification, not data accumulation), making it theoretically erodable if a competitor earns a stronger identity claim.

**Your switching cost target:** Build **workflow/integration switching costs first** — the most durable type available to a young product. Every HubSpot connection, every GA4 integration, every Meta Ads link-up makes your product more embedded in the customer's marketing stack. After 6 months of use, switching means losing campaign history, disconnecting integrations, and rebuilding workflows — a real cost that accrues without any contracts required.

**Watch indicator:** Track integration depth per account at 30/60/90 days post-signup. If accounts with 3+ integrations churn at <5% vs. >25% for accounts with 0 integrations (a typical SaaS integration moat pattern), your switching cost strategy is working.

## Part 4: Aggregation Theory — Who Owns the User Relationship

**The value chain for marketing PM:**

```
[Raw capability: compute/infrastructure]
        → [Platform layer: project data model, workflow engine]
        → [Product layer: PM tool]
        → [Distribution: self-serve / sales / app marketplace]
        → [User relationship: who the marketing team thinks of first]
        → [Monetization: per-seat SaaS]
```

**Aggregation Theory Decision Table:**

| Question | Asana | Monday.com | Notion | You |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Direct user relationship? | Yes — account is primary | Yes — work OS identity | Yes — workspace identity | Must build |
| Near-zero marginal cost? | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes (SaaS) |
| Acquisition costs decreasing with scale? | Yes (brand drives organic) | Partially (still paid-heavy) | Yes (community/PLG) | Not yet |
| Suppliers (integrations) can multi-home? | Yes — integrations are not exclusive | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**Critical finding:** None of the three competitors is a true Level 3 Aggregator (zero supply costs, decreasing acquisition costs) in the way Google or Meta is. They are Level 1-2 Aggregators — they own user relationships but growth still requires meaningful CAC investment.

**The most dangerous aggregation threat is Monday.com, not Asana.** Monday's Work OS strategy is explicitly an aggregation play: own more workflows per company → increase switching costs → decrease acquisition costs per new workflow (the next team in the company is an easy upsell). If Monday successfully bundles marketing PM into a company-wide Work OS platform, they can offer marketing PM at near-zero marginal revenue — funded by the CRM, Dev, and Service modules. This is the "bundled feature" threat to every vertical PM tool: the platform player offers your product as a feature at a price point you cannot compete with.

**Counter-strategy:** The Aggregation Theory answer is to own the **downstream user relationship** more completely than Monday — specifically, to become the tool the VP Marketing actively requests in budget conversations, rather than the tool IT provisions. Marketing teams who champion their PM tool (not just use it) are resistant to platform bundling because switching carries a political cost, not just a workflow cost.

**Value migration watch:** Watch for HubSpot adding project management features. HubSpot already owns the downstream marketing workflow (campaigns, leads, reporting). If they add a lightweight campaign PM layer, they become a more natural aggregator than Monday for marketing teams — because their user relationship is already grounded in marketing outcomes, not generic work management.

---

## Part 5: Disruption Theory — Vectors and COAP Analysis

### Disruption Vector Assessment

**Is the marketing PM market over-served or under-served?**

The correct answer is: **under-served for marketing-specific jobs, over-served for generic task management jobs.**

Evidence:
- Marketing teams consistently report using Asana/Monday for basic task tracking while maintaining separate tools for briefs (Google Docs), assets (Drive/Dropbox), calendars (spreadsheets), and reporting (separate dashboards). This is the "I need multiple tools to do what one tool should do" signal — a classic under-served market [Tier 6: community discussions on r/marketing, Product Hunt comments for PM tools — hypothesis-grade, needs Tier 1 validation via interviews].
- At the same time, marketing teams often report not using 60-70% of Asana's features — the task management layer is more than good enough for basic coordination [Tier 6: anecdotal — needs validation].

**Disruption Vector for Your Startup:**

| Vector | Applicable? | Mechanism | Evidence Grade |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Low-end disruption** | Partially | Enter at lower price, simpler feature set vs. Asana | Risky — Asana already has a free tier; ClickUp owns the price-disruption position |
| **New-market disruption** | Yes — primary vector | Serve marketing teams who are using spreadsheets + email + Drive as their "PM system" — non-consumption is real | Moderate [Tier 6: industry estimates suggest 40-60% of SMB marketing teams have no dedicated PM tool] |
| **Hybrid disruption** | Yes — ideal vector | Simpler than Asana for marketing-specific work AND accessible to teams who were never PM tool users | This is the Notion playbook — they did it for knowledge work; you do it for marketing |

**New-market disruption is the primary vector.** The real competitive set includes the team that coordinates campaigns in a shared Google Sheet and a Slack channel. These are not Asana customers you're taking — they are non-consumers you're creating a market for. This is a larger opportunity and a less defended position than trying to displace Asana's installed base.

### Conservation of Attractive Profits (COAP) Analysis

**Where are profits shifting in this value chain?**

```
Layer                          | Moving toward     | Profit direction
-------------------------------|-------------------|------------------
Generic task management        | Commodity         | Compressing → toward zero
Workflow automation            | Product/commodity | Compressing (everyone has rules)
Marketing-specific workflows   | Custom build      | Profit opportunity
Marketing outcome integration  | Genesis/custom    | High profit, unclaimed
AI-driven campaign intelligence| Genesis           | Highest profit, 2-3 year window
```

**COAP finding:** As generic project management commoditizes (ClickUp, free tiers, bundled platform features), profits shift upward to **the layer that connects execution to outcomes** — marketing analytics integration, campaign performance reporting, and eventually AI-driven campaign intelligence. This is the layer Asana, Monday, and Notion are not investing in.

**Strategic implication:** Build toward marketing outcome integration now, even if it's lightweight, because this is where COAP says profits will concentrate. A startup that owns "the PM tool that shows you how your campaigns performed" has a durable profit position; one that only owns "the PM tool for marketing tasks" will face margin compression as the task management layer commoditizes.

## Part 6: Revealed Strategy Test — Where to Play / How to Win

**The gap between what competitors say and what their resource allocation reveals:**

### Asana

| Dimension | What They SAY | What Resource Allocation REVEALS | Insight |
|---|---|---|---|
| Where to play | "Teams of all sizes, all types" | 65-70% revenue from enterprise ($50K+ ACV deals) [Tier 5: Asana investor materials]; pricing tier structure that prices out SMB | Enterprise company with a self-serve acquisition funnel — SMB is a pipeline, not a customer |
| How to win | "Best product wins" | ~40% of headcount in sales and CS [Tier 3: LinkedIn employee analysis, approximate]; Asana Intelligence as recent AI bet | Win on sales execution + brand trust, not product superiority; AI is a catch-up investment |
| Capabilities | "Work management for teams" | Enterprise security, SAML, audit logs, dedicated CSM at $25K+ ACV | IT-compatible, security-compliant enterprise tooling — not consumer-grade ease |
| Marketing vertical | "Templates for marketing teams" | No dedicated marketing PM product; marketing templates are a content marketing play | Marketing is a segment to retain, not a segment to lead. Low investment in marketing-specific depth. |

**Insight:** Asana is an enterprise company that uses a bottom-up PLG motion to fill its pipeline. Marketing teams are tolerated, not served. Their stated "for teams of all sizes" positioning is marketing; their actual strategy is enterprise land and expand.

### Monday.com

| Dimension | What They SAY | What Resource Allocation REVEALS | Insight |
|---|---|---|---|
| Where to play | "Every team, every workflow" | Fastest growth in 51-200 employee companies; Work OS expansion into CRM/Dev/Service [Tier 5: Monday earnings] | Platform-first, not team-first. They want to own the whole company's stack at mid-market. |
| How to win | "Adaptability and flexibility" | Monday Marketing, Monday CRM, Monday Dev — vertical products built on one platform | Win on platform breadth + per-company expansion revenue, not depth in any one vertical |
| AI investment | "Monday AI as a feature" | AI is incremental to the Work OS platform, not a standalone differentiator | AI is a parity investment for Monday; not a strategic weapon yet |

**Insight:** Monday is an aggregator-in-progress. Their "winning" looks like owning the entire company's workflows, not having the best marketing PM tool. Monday Marketing is a land-and-expand play, not a genuine commitment to serving marketing teams better than specialists.

### Notion

| Dimension | What They SAY | What Resource Allocation REVEALS | Insight |
|---|---|---|---|
| Where to play | "Replaces your notes, docs, wikis, and projects" | User base skews toward individuals, startups, and knowledge workers; weak enterprise motion [Tier 3: analyst commentary] | Consumer-grade knowledge tool with team features added, not an enterprise PM tool |
| How to win | "Connected, flexible workspace" | Notion AI investment (writing/summarization); Notion Calendar acquisition | Win on the document + AI layer; PM is secondary to knowledge management |
| Marketing vertical | No explicit marketing positioning | No marketing-specific product announced | Notion doesn't think of marketing teams as a priority segment — they're a use case |

**Insight:** Notion is a knowledge management company that markets to marketing teams by default (because marketing teams are knowledge workers). Their product decisions do not prioritize marketing-specific PM. They will not invest in closing the campaign lifecycle gap.

## Part 7: Wardley Map — Key Value Chain Components

```
VISIBLE TO USER
      │
High  ├── Campaign calendar [Product] → moving toward commodity
      │── Task management [Product] → already commodity
      │── Creative brief workflow [Custom Build] → differentiation opportunity
      │── Asset approval routing [Custom Build] → differentiation opportunity
      │── Campaign reporting [Custom Build] → differentiation opportunity
      │── Marketing integrations (HubSpot/GA4/Ads) [Genesis/Custom] → highest value
      │── AI campaign intelligence [Genesis] → future value
Low   └── Infrastructure (compute, storage, auth) [Commodity/Utility]
INVISIBLE TO USER

Evolution: Genesis → Custom Build → Product → Commodity/Utility →
```

**Strategic misallocations spotted:**

1. **All three incumbents are over-investing in commodity task management** — they're building automation rules, dependency management, and Gantt views that are already commodity. This investment doesn't differentiate; it just maintains parity.

2. **Creative brief and asset approval routing is still in Custom Build stage** — meaning it's a genuine differentiation opportunity, not yet commoditized. This is the Wardley signal to invest heavily here now, before it moves to Product stage and every competitor adds it.

3. **Marketing integrations (HubSpot/GA4/Ads) are still in Genesis/Custom stage** — no PM tool has standardized on these. This is the highest-value Wardley investment available to you.

**Decision trigger:** If a competitor begins hiring specifically for "HubSpot integration" or "marketing analytics integration" roles, they're moving into your territory. Watch LinkedIn job postings at Asana and Monday for signals 6-12 months ahead of product launches.

## Part 8: JTBD Competitive Analysis — What Jobs Are Marketing Teams Hiring For

**Marketing teams don't hire a PM tool. They hire it for specific jobs. The competitive set changes entirely when you define it by job.**

### Job Map for Marketing Teams

| Job | Current Hire | Satisfaction | Over/Under-served |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Functional:** "Coordinate who does what by when on this campaign" | Asana / Monday / spreadsheet | Moderate | Adequately served at task level; under-served at campaign level |
| **Functional:** "Keep our content calendar organized and visible" | Spreadsheet / CoSchedule / Notion | Low-Moderate | Under-served — no tool does this well as a connected planning surface |
| **Functional:** "Get approvals on creative assets efficiently" | Email / Slack / Bynder (enterprise) | Very Low | Severely under-served in mid-market |
| **Functional:** "Report on campaign execution to leadership" | Manual reporting / spreadsheet / screenshot of PM tool | Very Low | Severely under-served — no PM tool closes the execution→reporting loop |
| **Emotional:** "Feel in control of my campaigns" | None reliably | Very Low | Under-served — marketing PMs describe feeling overwhelmed managing campaigns in generic tools |
| **Emotional:** "Look competent to leadership and cross-functional partners" | Nothing purpose-built | Low | Under-served — a tool that makes marketing look professional drives emotional purchase |
| **Social:** "Signal that our marketing team is professional and organized" | Asana (by default) | Moderate | Partially served by Asana's brand, but Asana brand doesn't reinforce marketing team identity |

**JTBD Competitive landscape (full job view):**

The real competition for "coordinate campaign execution" is not only Asana — it includes:
- A shared Google Sheet updated every Monday in the team standup
- A Slack channel named #campaign-updates
- A weekly email from the marketing manager with a status doc attached
- Doing nothing and managing by hero effort

This is **non-consumption competition** — and it's probably the most common. Many marketing teams are not evaluating Asana vs. Monday; they're deciding whether to buy a PM tool at all.

**Decision Table — JTBD Assessment:**

| Signal | Interpretation | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Teams using multiple tools for one campaign lifecycle | Campaign lifecycle job is severely under-served | Build the end-to-end campaign workflow as the core product |
| Teams reporting creative approvals via email/Slack | Asset approval job is under-served | Prioritize creative approval routing in first 6 months |
| Marketing PMs building custom Notion/Airtable systems | Job is under-served; workaround reveals the desired solution | Interview these "super users" — their workarounds are your product roadmap |
| "Do nothing / spreadsheet" is the main competitor | New-market disruption opportunity | Lower barriers to adoption; zero-setup templates; strong time-to-first-value |

---

## Part 9: Data Content Loops — Does This Market Have One?

**Applying the Rich Barton / Kevin Kwok playbook:**

Is there an intermediary hoarding information in marketing PM that you could disintermediate?

The most promising Data Content Loop opportunity: **marketing performance benchmarks**.

Marketing teams have no reliable public data on what "good" looks like for campaign performance by industry, team size, or channel mix. This information is hoarded by:
- Marketing agencies (who won't share client data)
- Marketing analytics tools (who share generic industry benchmarks but not execution-correlated data)
- Large platform players (Google, Meta — who share platform-specific data but not cross-channel or execution-correlated data)

**The loop:** If you aggregate anonymized campaign execution + outcome data across customers → publish industry benchmarks ("Marketing teams in SaaS of 10-50 employees ship X campaigns/quarter with Y% on-time rate") → these become authoritative pages that rank for search → marketing teams find you via organic discovery → they join to access benchmarks → their data improves the benchmarks → loop compounds.

**Loop strength assessment:** Medium — the data you accumulate will be genuinely proprietary if you achieve critical mass (200+ teams), and the benchmark content will be hard for competitors to replicate without the same installed base. The challenge: you need critical mass before the loop compounds, and you need marketing outcome data (not just execution data) to make the benchmarks meaningful. This requires the HubSpot/GA4 integrations to be built first.

**Timeline:** This is a 24-36 month strategy, not a launch strategy. But it should be architected into your data model from day one.

## Part 10: Blue Ocean Strategy — Should You Reframe the Competitive Arena?

**Strategy Canvas — Plotting the competitive dimensions:**

| Competitive Factor | Asana | Monday.com | Notion | Your Target Curve |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Task management depth | ████████░░ High | ██████░░░░ Medium | ████░░░░░░ Low-Med | ████░░░░░░ Medium (good enough) |
| Automation / workflow rules | ████████░░ High | █████████░ High | ██░░░░░░░░ Low | ████░░░░░░ Medium |
| Campaign lifecycle structure | ██░░░░░░░░ Low | ████░░░░░░ Med | ██░░░░░░░░ Low | █████████░ High |
| Marketing integrations | ████░░░░░░ Low-Med | ████░░░░░░ Low-Med | ██░░░░░░░░ Low | ████████░░ High |
| Creative asset workflow | ██░░░░░░░░ Low | ████░░░░░░ Med | ██░░░░░░░░ Low | ████████░░ High |
| Campaign reporting | ████░░░░░░ Med | █████░░░░░ Med | ██░░░░░░░░ Low | ████████░░ High |
| Enterprise security features | █████████░ High | █████████░ High | ██████░░░░ Med | ███░░░░░░░ Low-Med |
| Platform breadth / Work OS | ████████░░ High | █████████░ High | ██████░░░░ Med | ██░░░░░░░░ Low |
| Price per user (SMB) | ████░░░░░░ Expensive | ████░░░░░░ Expensive | ███░░░░░░░ Moderate | ████████░░ Accessible |
| Time-to-first-value for marketing | ████░░░░░░ Slow | █████░░░░░ Med | █████░░░░░ Med | █████████░ Fast |

**Strategy Canvas Reading:** All three incumbents have similar curves on the left side of this canvas (task management, automation, enterprise security, platform breadth) — they are competing on the same dimensions. Your curve diverges radically on the right: campaign lifecycle, marketing integrations, creative workflow, campaign reporting. This is a genuine Blue Ocean signal — you are not competing on the same factors.

**ERRC Grid:**

| Factor | Eliminate | Reduce | Raise | Create |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Enterprise security / compliance complexity at launch | ✅ | | | |
| Platform breadth / Work OS ambition | ✅ | | | |
| Generic task management depth | | ✅ | | |
| Workflow automation complexity | | ✅ | | |
| Campaign lifecycle structure | | | ✅ | |
| Marketing-specific integrations (HubSpot/GA4/Ads) | | | ✅ | |
| Time-to-first-value (new marketing team) | | | ✅ | |
| Campaign→outcome closed-loop reporting | | | | ✅ |
| Marketing team performance benchmarks | | | | ✅ |
| AI-native campaign intelligence | | | | ✅ |

**Blue Ocean conclusion:** The competitive arena can and should be reframed. You are not entering the "project management tool" market — you are creating the "campaign management" market. This reframe has real implications for how you describe yourself, which review categories you compete in (G2: "Marketing Project Management" is a real category, distinct from "Project Management"), and which buyers you target (VP Marketing / Director of Marketing vs. COO / Head of Operations who typically buys PM tools).

**Six Paths Check — which path are you on?**

You are primarily on **Path 2 (Strategic groups within the industry)**: looking across the PM tool category AND the marketing software category to find buyers who trade between them. Marketing teams often choose between a dedicated marketing tool (CoSchedule, Sprout Social, HubSpot Projects) and a generic PM tool (Asana, Monday). You are competing for buyers who want the structure of a PM tool with the marketing intelligence of a dedicated marketing product.

You are also on **Path 4 (Complementary products)**: looking at what happens before and after the PM tool is used. Before: marketing strategy docs, campaign briefs in Google Docs. After: campaign performance reporting in a spreadsheet or analytics dashboard. Owning both the pre-campaign planning and post-campaign reporting workflow is a Blue Ocean move that no PM competitor currently makes.

## Part 11: Technology Adoption Lifecycle — Where Is This Market

**Assessment:**

The **horizontal PM tool market** is in **Late Majority / Early Majority transition** — Asana and Monday have crossed the chasm and are in mainstream adoption. This means the rules that win in horizontal PM are: references, integrations, whole product, low TCO. You cannot compete with incumbents on the horizontal PM lifecycle.

The **marketing-vertical PM market** is **pre-chasm** — no player has established the whole product, no player has the reference base, and the segment has not yet standardized on a tool. This is where you live.

```
Innovators → Early Adopters → [THE CHASM] → Early Majority → Late Majority
                                    ↑
              Marketing-vertical PM is HERE. You must cross the chasm.
```

**The Whole Product Gap for Marketing Teams:**

| What Core Product Provides | What Whole Product Requires | Who Provides It Today |
|---|---|---|
| Task management | Campaign lifecycle templates ready on day 1 | No one — you must provide |
| Notifications | Integration with Slack + email already configured | Asana (partially); you must match |
| Basic reporting | Marketing-specific dashboards (campaign status, delivery rate) | No one — you must provide |
| Free trial | Reference customers from similar marketing teams | No one — you must build this |
| File storage | HubSpot / GA4 integration | No one — you must build this |
| Task views | Content calendar as a first-class view | No one — you must provide |

**Whole Product Gap = your most urgent roadmap constraint.** Marketing teams in the Early Majority won't buy until the whole product exists. They need to see: "This tool works for a marketing team like ours" (reference) + "It connects to the tools we already use" (integrations) + "We can be up and running in a day" (onboarding).

**Bowling Alley Strategy — Crossing the Chasm:**

**Head pin selection:** You need one niche to dominate first. The best options are:

| Niche | Pain Level | Reachable Whole Product | Reference Value | Adjacent Niches |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Content marketing teams (10-30 people)** | Very High — editorial calendar + cross-team coordination + briefing is a constant struggle | Yes — can build whole product for this niche in 6 months | High — content marketing is a distinct community; G2Crowd/Substack word-of-mouth spreads fast | Demand gen teams, brand teams |
| **Demand gen / growth marketing teams** | High — campaign management across channels, high velocity | Moderate — requires HubSpot integration for whole product | High — demand gen is a measurable function; ROI story is clearer | Content teams, lifecycle marketing |
| **In-house creative / brand teams** | High — approval workflows, asset management, creative briefs are broken | Moderate — requires asset management features | Moderate — smaller community | Agency management, content teams |
| **Marketing agencies managing client campaigns** | Very High — multi-client campaign coordination, client reporting | Moderate — requires external collaborator access | High — agencies recommend tools to clients | In-house marketing teams |

**Recommended head pin: Content marketing teams (10-30 people) at growth-stage B2B companies.**

Rationale: (a) Very acute, well-articulated pain; (b) Reachable whole product within 6 months; (c) Active community (Content Marketing Institute, Substack content marketing circles, Slack communities) for rapid word-of-mouth; (d) Adjacent to demand gen, which is the next pin; (e) These teams frequently evaluate tools and write publicly about what works.

**Crossing the chasm for this segment:**
1. Get 10 content marketing teams running in the product within 90 days of launch (offer white-glove onboarding for beta cohort)
2. Get 3 public case studies from recognizable brands within 6 months
3. Own the "marketing project management" category on G2 before larger players invest in review generation
4. Build the editorial calendar view and content brief template that becomes the default in this segment — templates spread virally

## Part 12: Asymmetric Competition Map

**Critical question: Are competitors actually playing the same game?**

### Asana
- **Optimizes for:** Enterprise ARR per account; net revenue retention from expansion
- **Willing to sacrifice:** SMB/mid-market marketing-specific depth; self-serve simplicity
- **Time horizon:** 2-3 year enterprise contracts; multi-year platform investments
- **Winning looks like:** Every knowledge worker in a Fortune 1000 on Asana; $1B+ ARR from enterprise
- **Cost to add 1 marketing user:** ~$0 marginal (fully scaled infrastructure); but $X00+ CAC from sales-led motion

### Monday.com
- **Optimizes for:** Revenue per company (multiple workflow modules per account); Work OS platform adoption
- **Willing to sacrifice:** Depth in any single vertical; best-in-class for any specific team type
- **Time horizon:** 5-10 year platform bets; multiple products on one platform
- **Winning looks like:** Monday is the default work coordination layer for 50,000+ mid-market companies across all functions
- **Cost to add 1 marketing user:** Near-zero marginal (existing platform); but acquired as part of company-wide deal, not standalone marketing sale

### Notion
- **Optimizes for:** User base growth (total users, community size); bottom-up adoption in companies
- **Willing to sacrifice:** Structured workflow depth; enterprise compliance features; PM completeness
- **Time horizon:** 3-5 year consumer/SMB growth; AI platform investment
- **Winning looks like:** Every knowledge worker's personal productivity + team wiki is in Notion; AI writing assistant becomes default
- **Cost to add 1 user:** Near-zero (PLG flywheel); brand and community drive organic acquisition

### Your Startup
- **Optimizes for:** Marketing team retention and NPS; word-of-mouth referral rate
- **Willing to sacrifice:** Platform breadth; enterprise features; generic PM completeness
- **Time horizon:** 18-month head pin domination; 36-month marketing PM category leadership
- **Winning looks like:** "Marketing PM tool" is a recognized product category and you lead it on G2, referral rate, and NPS among marketing teams
- **Cost to add 1 user:** High CAC initially (community + content investment); decreasing as referral flywheel starts

**Asymmetric competition finding:** You are not competing on the same dimension as any of these three. Asana and Monday are optimizing for enterprise platform revenue; you are optimizing for marketing team NPS. Notion is optimizing for user growth across all knowledge workers; you are optimizing for the campaign-running marketer specifically. This asymmetry is your advantage — you can make decisions (deep marketing integrations, campaign-specific views, outcome reporting) that they would not make because those decisions don't serve their optimization function.

**H3 scenario planning:**

| Scenario | Probability | Key Driver | Response |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| 🟢 Base: Marketing PM matures as a recognized category; you lead it | 50% | Category creation succeeds; incumbents slow to respond | Execute bowling alley strategy; build brand and review base |
| 🔵 Bull: HubSpot builds Projects and legitimizes the category you've created — you become the next HubSpot acquisition | 20% | HubSpot recognizes marketing PM as a strategic layer; acquires rather than builds | Build deep HubSpot integration that creates acquisition value; be acquirable |
| 🔴 Bear: Monday or Asana launches a dedicated marketing PM product with full feature depth and their existing sales motion | 30% | Incumbent commits resources to this niche before you establish reference base | Accelerate chasm-crossing; get references; build switching costs before they enter; deepen counter-positioning on outcome integration (which they can't replicate without changing their identity) |

## Part 14: Feature / Capability Matrix with Strategic Weights

**Strategic weight = how often this capability is a primary purchase driver for your target segment (content + demand gen marketing teams, 10-30 people)**

| Capability | Strategic Weight | Asana | Monday | Notion | Your Target |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Campaign lifecycle (brief→launch→retro) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Critical | ❌ Absent | 🔄 Partial | ❌ Absent | ✅ Must-have |
| Content calendar (first-class view) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Critical | 🚧 Weak | 🔄 Partial | 🔄 Partial | ✅ Must-have |
| Creative brief templates (marketing-native) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | 🚧 Weak | 🔄 Partial | 🔄 Partial | ✅ Must-have |
| Task dependencies | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium | ✅ Strong | 🔄 Adequate | ❌ Absent | 🔄 Adequate |
| HubSpot / CRM integration | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Critical | 🔄 Partial | 🔄 Partial | 🚧 Weak | ✅ Must-have |
| GA4 / Analytics integration | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | ❌ Absent | 🚧 Weak | ❌ Absent | ✅ Must-have |
| Ads platform integration (Meta/Google) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | ❌ Absent | ❌ Absent | ❌ Absent | 🔄 Phase 2 |
| Asset approval routing | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | 🚧 Weak | 🚧 Weak | ❌ Absent | ✅ Must-have |
| Campaign performance reporting | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Critical | 🚧 Weak | 🔄 Partial | ❌ Absent | ✅ Must-have |
| External collaborator (agency) access | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium | 🔄 Adequate | 🔄 Adequate | 🚧 Weak | 🔄 Phase 2 |
| Workflow automation | ⭐⭐ Low-Med | ✅ Strong | ✅ Strong | 🚧 Weak | 🔄 Adequate |
| Enterprise SSO / security | ⭐ Low (at launch) | ✅ Strong | ✅ Strong | 🔄 Adequate | 🚧 Later |
| Mobile experience | ⭐⭐ Low-Med | 🔄 Adequate | 🔄 Adequate | 🔄 Adequate | 🔄 Adequate |

**Legend:** ✅ Strong/Delivered | 🔄 Partial/Adequate | 🚧 Weak/Minimal | ❌ Absent

**Strategic read:** On the five critical capabilities (campaign lifecycle, content calendar, HubSpot integration, campaign reporting, creative brief templates), all three incumbents are weak or absent. This is an extraordinary table — you have clean whitespace on every dimension that matters most to your target buyer.

## Part 15: Win/Loss Patterns Mapped to Framework Conclusions

**Pre-launch hypothesis: these are the win/loss patterns you should expect and how to interpret them structurally.**

| Win/Loss Pattern | Structural Framework Implication | Response |
|---|---|---|
| "Lost to Asana because company already uses it for eng/ops" | 7 Powers: Asana's Switching Cost (Workflow/Integration) is active; this is incumbent advantage, not product preference | Target companies without an enterprise-wide PM tool mandate; build Asana import tool; position as "for marketing what Asana is for eng" |
| "Lost to Monday Marketing because prospect already on Monday Work OS" | Aggregation Theory: Monday is bundling PM as a platform feature — economic threat, not product threat | You cannot win price battles against bundled platform features; win on depth and marketing outcomes; ensure prospects are making an active choice, not a passive default |
| "Won because competitor couldn't show them what campaigns actually achieved" | 7 Powers + COAP: campaign outcome integration is a durable differentiator where profits are migrating | Double down on outcome reporting; make this the centerpiece of every demo |
| "Lost to 'do nothing / keep using spreadsheets'" | JTBD: non-consumption is the real competitor; job is under-served but activation energy is high | Build a "spreadsheet importer" and a "your first campaign in 30 minutes" onboarding that converts fence-sitters |
| "Won because the team just started and had no existing system" | Crossing the Chasm: new-market disruption; no switching costs, no incumbent to displace | Optimize for this buyer archetype at launch; build referral mechanism for "new marketing team" context |
| "Lost because they needed references from similar companies" | Crossing the Chasm: reference gap = you're pre-chasm in this vertical | Accelerate reference case studies; prioritize 5 anchor customer stories in different sub-verticals |
| "Lost to ClickUp on price" | Blue Ocean: price competition means you're competing on the wrong dimension | Reinforce your differentiation story; a buyer choosing on price is not your buyer |

## Part 16: Strategic Recommendations with Confidence and Watch Indicators

### Recommendation 1: Enter as the campaign management tool, not the marketing PM tool

**Observation:** All three incumbents define their product as "project management" or "work management." The category language is task-centric.

**Implication:** A marketing team evaluating "marketing project management tools" is already in a frame where Asana and Monday are the reference points. You will lose on feature breadth in that frame.

**Response:** Define the category as "campaign management" or "the tool where campaigns live." This reframe means competing in G2's "Marketing Project Management" subcategory and potentially creating a new one. Every marketing asset, every review, every website headline should use campaign-first language.

**Confidence:** High (70%) — the category reframe has worked for other vertical PM tools (Shortcut for engineering, ServiceNow for ITSM). Risk: market may not recognize "campaign management" as a distinct category yet, requiring education investment.

**Watch indicator:** Monthly, check G2's "marketing project management" category for new reviews, new entrants, and category definition changes. If Asana or Monday begins using "campaign management" language in their marketing, the reframe is working — and you need to accelerate.

---

### Recommendation 2: Build HubSpot integration in first 90 days, GA4 in first 6 months

**Observation:** No PM tool has a functional HubSpot integration. Marketing teams using HubSpot (which is most B2B marketing teams) have zero connection between their PM tool and their marketing execution data.

**Implication:** The first PM tool to build a genuine HubSpot integration — not just a Zapier connection, but a real two-way sync where HubSpot campaigns connect to PM tasks — creates the switching cost moat that no incumbent currently has. This is customer-created switching cost of the most durable type (data + workflow).

**Response:** Prioritize HubSpot integration as a launch-adjacent feature (within 90 days). Prioritize GA4 integration for campaign outcome reporting within 6 months.

**Confidence:** High (75%) — HubSpot integration is technically achievable within 90 days for a basic sync; the strategic value is high. Risk: HubSpot may add native project management before you ship (est. 20% probability within 12 months).

**Watch indicator:** HubSpot job postings for "project management" or "campaign operations" product roles. HubSpot blog posts about "campaign management" features. These are leading indicators of product direction.

---

### Recommendation 3: Win the G2 "marketing project management" category before incumbents invest in review generation

**Observation:** G2 category leadership in "marketing project management" is currently fragmented. No tool has 50+ reviews specifically positioned in this category.

**Implication:** G2 category leadership is a cornered resource if you establish it early — review moats are self-reinforcing (more reviews → more traffic → more evaluators → more reviews). The cost of building this moat grows as more players invest.

**Response:** Launch a structured review generation program targeting your first 50 customers. Get 50 verified G2 reviews within 6 months of launch. Target the "marketing project management" subcategory specifically, not the broader "project management" category where Asana and Monday dominate.

**Confidence:** High (80%) — G2 category moat-building is established playbook; timing advantage is real. Risk: requires a customer base, which requires first nailing product and onboarding.

**Watch indicator:** Monthly G2 review count for your product and for "marketing project management" category. If Asana or Monday begins a review generation campaign in this subcategory, accelerate.

---

### Recommendation 4: Resist platform expansion for 24 months

**Observation:** Monday's strategy is to expand into every workflow. Asana is adding AI, goals, and resource management. The temptation when building a PM tool is to add more.

**Implication:** Every feature that is not campaign-management-specific dilutes your counter-position and increases your engineering surface area. Monday and Asana have the scale to absorb that surface area; you do not.

**Response:** Define a hard product perimeter: "Does this feature make campaigns run better or does it make campaign outcomes more visible?" If no, it doesn't belong in your product for 24 months.

**Confidence:** Moderate (60%) — the risk is that staying focused means losing deals to competitors who can offer "more." Counter: the deals you lose to Asana because you don't have resource management are not your customers. The deals you win because you are the only tool that shows campaign ROI are your customers.

**Watch indicator:** Track the reason code for every lost deal. If >30% of losses cite "missing features unrelated to campaign management," the perimeter may need to expand. If <15% of losses cite missing non-campaign features, stay focused.

---

## Summary: Competitive War Map

**The market in three sentences:** Generic PM tools are commoditizing (profits migrating to integrations and outcomes); no player has built the marketing-vertical whole product; and the market is pre-chasm for marketing-specific PM, meaning the first player to establish references, integrations, and category language in the campaign management space will cross the chasm before any incumbent responds.

**Your position:** Counter-position on campaign management. Build the switching costs incumbents don't have (HubSpot/GA4/Ads integrations). Cross the chasm via the content marketing team head pin. Own the G2 category before incumbents invest in it.

**The one thing that must be true for this to work:** The campaign lifecycle must be the best-executed feature in your product by the time you have 50 customers. Not adequate — best. Everything else follows from that.
