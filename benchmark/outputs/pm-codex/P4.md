# COMPETITIVE WAR MAP: Visier Free Tier Response
## HR Analytics Platform — Strategic Response Brief
**Prepared for:** CEO
**Deadline:** Monday
**Analyst:** VP Product
**Situation:** Visier raised $125M, launched free tier for sub-500 employee companies (our exact ICP), 3 customer downgrades in 30 days

---

## Executive Summary (5 Sentences — Act on This Alone If Needed)

Visier's free tier is not a product decision — it is an Aggregation Theory land-and-expand move: commoditize our segment at the acquisition layer to own the data relationship before customers grow into their paid tier. Our **200% NRR is a lagging indicator of health; it says nothing about the next 50 logos we need to win in a newly price-disrupted market.** We hold durable Switching Cost power (Data/Migration type, customer-created) in our installed base, but our Branding and Scale Economy powers are weak — and Visier's free tier attacks precisely the gap between "people who already use us" and "people deciding who to try first." **The correct response is not a free tier counter; it is a three-track strategy: (1) defend installed base by surfacing and deepening customer-created switching costs, (2) counter-position on the dimension Visier cannot serve at freemium economics — dedicated partnership and time-to-value for resource-constrained HR teams, and (3) launch a $0-to-value AI layer within 90 days that makes the "free vs. paid" framing irrelevant.** The 3 downgrades are the least important signal; the most important signal is what's happening in your pipeline in the next 60 days — instrument that immediately.

## Part 1: Competitive Set Definition

### Primary Competitors (Full Analysis)

| Competitor | Category | Relevant Move | Analysis Depth |
|-----------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Visier** | HR Analytics — Market Leader | $125M raise + free tier for sub-500 | Full: all 9 frameworks |
| **Culture Amp** | Employee Experience + Analytics | Engagement-first, expanding into analytics | Full |
| **Workday Peakon** | HRIS-bundled analytics | Analytics as a feature of HRIS contract | Full |

### Secondary Competitors (7 Powers Scan + JTBD Overlap)

| Competitor | Threat Vector | Timeline to Direct Competition |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| **Microsoft Viva Insights** | M365 bundle — near-zero marginal cost to add HR analytics to existing M365 customers | 12-18 months if they prioritize SMB |
| **BambooHR / Rippling embedded analytics** | "Good enough" analytics as a feature of HRIS; same buyer, lower switching cost to upgrade | Now — already displacing standalone analytics for sub-150 companies |
| **Lattice** | Performance + engagement platform expanding analytics; similar ICP | 6-12 months into our core use cases |
| **Tableau/Power BI + HRIS connector** | DIY analytics — increasingly accessible with Copilot integration | Now for companies with any BI infrastructure |

### Non-Obvious / Paradigm Threats (H3 — 36 months+)

| Threat | Mechanism | Probability | Leading Indicator |
|--------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **LLM-native HR analytics** | A GPT-wrapper startup offers "ask your HRIS anything in English" — commoditizes all current analytics UIs | High (12-24 months for credible product) | Glean, Guru, Notion AI entering HRIS connectivity |
| **HRIS provider vertical integration** | Workday, ADP, Rippling decide that analytics is a retention feature and bundle it at no additional cost | Moderate (18-36 months) | Workday hiring ML/analytics PMs; ADP Workforce Now AI roadmap |
| **Benchmarking data aggregators** | A company like LinkedIn or Radford owns the benchmarking layer and unbundles it from HR analytics entirely | Low-Moderate | LinkedIn Talent Insights expansion into workforce planning |

## Part 2: 7 Powers Heat Map

*Script not available — estimates below are approximate. Validate with win/loss data (Tier 1) before board-level decisions.*

### 7 Powers Assessment — Primary Competitors

| Power | Visier | Culture Amp | Workday Peakon | **Our Product** |
|-------|:------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|
| **Scale Economies** | 🟢 Strong | 🟡 Moderate | 🟢 Strong | 🔴 Weak |
| **Network Effects** | 🟡 Data NE (benchmark dataset) | 🟡 Community NE | 🔴 None (HRIS = supply, not demand NE) | 🔴 None |
| **Counter-Positioning** | 🔴 None vs. us | 🟡 Engagement-first | 🟢 vs. standalone (bundled into HCM) | 🟡 Partnership model vs. Visier |
| **Switching Costs** | 🟢 Data + Workflow (customer-created) | 🟡 Data moderate | 🟢 HRIS-embedded (highest type) | 🟡 Data moderate, workflow moderate |
| **Branding** | 🟢 Gartner Leader; analyst darling | 🟡 Culture brand | 🟡 Workday halo | 🔴 Nascent in segment |
| **Cornered Resource** | 🟡 Benchmark dataset (50K+ companies) | 🔴 None | 🟢 Workday data access | 🔴 None |
| **Process Power** | 🟡 Enterprise sales motion | 🔴 None | 🟡 Workday PS org | 🟡 CS partnership model |

### Accruing vs. Eroding Assessment

**Visier:**
- Scale Economies: 🔼 Accruing — $125M accelerates infrastructure investment
- Benchmark Data (Cornered Resource): 🔼 Accruing — more free customers = more data = better benchmarks = stronger moat. **This is the hidden flywheel in their free tier.**
- Switching Costs: 🔼 Accruing — free tier gets data and workflows embedded before customers can evaluate alternatives

**Our Product:**
- Switching Costs (Data/Migration): 🔼 Accruing for existing customers with 2+ years of history
- Switching Costs (Workflow/Integration): 🔼 Accruing for deeply integrated accounts
- Branding: 🔴 Flat or declining — Visier's raise draws analyst attention away from the #2 player
- Counter-Positioning (Partnership): ⚠️ Only accruing if we invest in making it structurally visible — currently implicit, not a recognized market position

**Critical Decision Point from Heat Map:** Visier holds 4+ powers (Scale, Switching Costs, Branding, Cornered Resource) and they are all accruing. The market has a likely long-term winner if the current power structure holds. **We cannot out-muscle them on their powers. The strategic imperative is counter-positioning — find the dimension where matching our move would cannibalize their model.**

*Free tier estimates — validate with product intelligence this week*

### Critical Switching Cost Insight

**Visier's free tier enters with near-zero switching costs** — financial (no contract), data (no history yet), workflow (no integrations built), relational (no CSM relationship). This is the attack vector.

**As customers use the free tier, switching costs compound automatically:** Data history builds. Workflows embed around Visier's interface. HR teams learn Visier's report builder. After 12-18 months, a company that "just used the free tier" faces all the same switching costs as a paid customer — at which point Visier converts them.

**Our relational/trust switching cost is our highest and most durable** (8/10 vs. Visier free tier's 0/10) — but this is *vendor-created*, not customer-created. A CSM relationship can be rebuilt if a better product or lower price arrives. We need to convert relational switching costs into customer-created ones: their data history, their custom reports, their embedded HR workflows.

**Strategic Implication:** For at-risk accounts, the question is not "how do we keep them paying?" It is "how many customer-created switching costs have they accumulated?" An account with 3+ years of history, 200+ custom dashboards, and 5 HRIS integrations is structurally retained even at Visier free tier pricing pressure. An account with 8 months of history and 3 standard reports is vulnerable.

**Immediate Action:** Run a switching cost audit on all 150 accounts. Score each one: data history (months), custom assets (reports/dashboards), integration count, workflow dependencies, champion tenure. This is your churn risk map, and it's more accurate than any health score.

## Part 4: Aggregation Theory Analysis

### Who Owns the User Relationship?

| Question | Assessment |
|----------|-----------|
| Does Visier have a direct user relationship? | Yes — paid and now free. They control the account relationship at all tiers. |
| Are marginal costs near zero for free tier? | Yes — cloud SaaS, data already ingested; cost per additional free user is near-zero for them at scale |
| Are acquisition costs decreasing with scale? | Benchmark dataset creates a data content loop: more users → better benchmarks → better product → lower CAC. Flywheel is active. |
| Can suppliers (HRIS data) multi-home? | Yes — BambooHR, Workday, ADP all support multiple integrations. No exclusivity. |

### The Aggregation Theory Verdict

**Visier is executing a Level 2 → Level 3 Aggregator transition.** Their paid tier was Level 2 (incurs onboarding/sales costs). The free tier moves toward Level 3 (zero marginal supplier cost, demand-side economics). The benchmark dataset is their aggregation flywheel: each company on the platform contributes anonymized data → benchmark dataset improves → more companies attracted by better benchmarks → more data.

**The $125M raise is not about free tier sustainability costs — it is about accelerating the benchmark data flywheel before competitors can replicate it.** In 3-5 years, Visier's benchmark dataset covering 50,000+ companies across all sizes will be a Cornered Resource no well-funded competitor can replicate from scratch.

**Where is value migrating?** Away from analytics UI (commoditizing — free tiers prove it) toward benchmark data and workflow integration. The company that owns the most comprehensive, most granular workforce benchmark dataset will dictate the market.

**Implication for us:** We need a benchmark data strategy. Not necessarily matching Visier's enterprise dataset, but owning the *small/mid-market specific benchmark* for companies under 1,000 employees. This is a dataset Visier's enterprise-weighted data cannot serve as well. This is a Cornered Resource we can build.

## Part 5: Disruption Vector Assessment

### Christensen's Disruption Analysis — Visier's Free Tier Move

**Disruption Type: Hybrid (Low-End + New Market)**

| Vector | Evidence | Assessment |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Low-end disruption** | Free tier for existing market segment (sub-500 employees) — "good enough" at dramatically lower cost | ✅ Active — targeting over-served customers who don't need Visier's full enterprise suite |
| **New-market disruption** | Sub-100 employee companies that never purchased HR analytics at all | ✅ Active — Visier is expanding TAM, not just stealing share |
| **Hybrid signal** | Both price disruption AND demographic expansion happening simultaneously | ✅ Confirmed — this is the most dangerous form |

### "Good Enough" / "More Than Good Enough" Assessment

The critical question: Are our customers over-served or under-served?

**Evidence that our customers are over-served (disruption risk):**
- 3 downgrades suggest some customers feel they don't need everything in the full tier
- If feature utilization data shows <40% of capabilities actively used by typical customer, disruption risk is confirmed
- The existence of a viable free alternative at all signals the market perceives the basic job as servable at lower cost

**Evidence that our customers are under-served (we're safe):**
- 200% NRR suggests customers find more value over time, not less — expansion > churn
- Customers are buying MORE, not requesting less
- Active use of predictive analytics, custom integrations, and reporting suggests jobs are not fully served

**Assessment:** The market is bifurcating. **Segment A** (companies using HR analytics for simple headcount and turnover reporting) is over-served and vulnerable to Visier's free tier. **Segment B** (companies using predictive attrition, workforce planning, and deep integration) is under-served and our growth segment. The 3 downgrades are likely all Segment A customers.

**COAP Analysis (Conservation of Attractive Profits):**

| Value Chain Layer | Commoditizing? | Profits Shifting To |
|------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Analytics UI / dashboards | YES — free tier proves it | Upstream (data/benchmarks) or downstream (workflow integration) |
| Standard HR metrics | YES — BambooHR, Rippling bundle these | Predictive models; custom analytics |
| Data ingestion / HRIS connectors | Becoming commodity (standard APIs) | Data interpretation; insight generation |
| Benchmark data | NOT yet — Visier's moat is here | Will remain scarce; rents will accrue here |
| Workflow embedding | NOT — switching costs are here | Whoever deepens workflow will capture margin |
| AI-generated insight | GENESIS — no incumbent owns it | Will be the next premium layer |

**The most important finding from COAP:** Profits are shifting from analytics UI to (a) proprietary benchmark data and (b) AI-generated workforce insights. Both of these are adjacent layers we need to invest in immediately — not as features, but as the new value center of our product.

## Part 6: Where to Play / How to Win — Revealed Strategy Analysis

### Visier's Revealed Strategy (What Resource Allocation Shows)

| Dimension | What They SAY | What $125M Raise + Free Tier REVEALS |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Where to play | "Enterprise workforce intelligence" | Sub-500 employee land-and-expand to build data flywheel while competitors sleep |
| How to win | "Comprehensive analytics + benchmarking" | Own the data relationship before companies grow into their paid tier; monetize at scale |
| Capabilities required | "Enterprise-grade analytics" | High-volume data ingestion at near-zero marginal cost; freemium funnel optimization |
| Time horizon | "Building for the next phase of HR" | 3-5 year land-and-expand: free today → upgrade pressure in 18-24 months when $125M must show ROI |

**The Insight the PR Doesn't Reveal:** Visier's free tier is not philanthropy or an experiment. It is a calculated move to acquire the benchmark dataset from the sub-500 segment before that segment is contested, while simultaneously starving #2 and #3 players of new customer acquisition. The free tier costs them approximately nothing at their infrastructure scale, and every new company that signs up — even if they never pay — contributes workforce data to Visier's benchmark dataset.

**Our Revealed Strategy (What Our Resource Allocation Shows):**

| Dimension | Our Stated | Our Revealed |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Where to play | "HR analytics for growing companies" | Sub-500 employee companies with enough complexity to need dedicated analytics |
| How to win | "Better product + partnership" | Win on customer success relationship depth + product implementation support |
| Capabilities | "Deep analytics + integrations" | CS-led motion; implementation-heavy onboarding; high-touch retention |
| Time horizon | "Scale to enterprise" | Unclear — 200% NRR shows strong SMB execution but no visible enterprise motion |

**Strategic Gap Revealed:** Our how-to-win is "partnership and support" — which is genuinely differentiated from Visier's scale-driven model. But this advantage is **currently implicit** (customers experience it, but it's not why they evaluate us in competitive deals). We need to make it explicit, measurable, and marketed.

## Part 7: Wardley Mapping — Component Evolution

### HR Analytics Value Chain — Evolution Stage Assessment

| Component | Stage | Our Position | Visier's Position | Strategic Implication |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Core HR metrics (headcount, turnover) | **Commodity** | Providing commodity | Providing commodity + free | Compete here = race to zero |
| HRIS data connectors | **Product → Commodity** | Standard connectors | Standard + wider | Marginal differentiation |
| Analytics UI / dashboards | **Product** | Good execution | Better execution | Feature parity is table stakes |
| Predictive attrition models | **Custom → Product** | Moderate capability | Strong capability | Invest to reach parity |
| Benchmark data | **Custom** | Weak | Strong (proprietary) | Build a parallel SMB benchmark dataset |
| Natural language analytics (AI) | **Genesis → Custom** | None/early | None/early | First mover opportunity — 12-month window |
| Dedicated HR analytics partnership | **Custom** | Strong (implicit) | Absent (structural) | Codify and market this |
| Workforce financial planning | **Custom** | Weak | Adequate | 12-18 month investment horizon |

**Wardley Strategic Misallocation Detection:**

- **Visier is investing custom effort on commoditizing components** (analytics UI, standard connectors) as part of their free tier — deliberately, because the free tier's goal is not margin, it is data acquisition. Do not interpret this as a sustainable model to imitate.
- **We are under-investing in genesis components** (AI-native analytics, NLP query interface) where the 12-month window for first-mover advantage is open.
- **We are over-invested in relational switching costs** (CSM relationships) relative to customer-created switching costs (data history, custom assets, workflow integration) — the former is erodable, the latter is durable.

## Part 8: JTBD Competitive Analysis

### Jobs HR Teams at Sub-500 Employee Companies Are Hiring For

| Job Dimension | Job Description | Current Satisfaction Level | Who They Hire |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| **Functional (primary)** | "Know what's happening with my workforce before the CEO asks me" | Moderate — current tools report, don't predict | Us, Visier, or manual Excel |
| **Functional (secondary)** | "Justify HR budget to the CFO with data" | Low — few tools help HR speak CFO language | Often unsatisfied — uses our ROI calculators ad hoc |
| **Emotional** | "Feel confident I won't be surprised by an attrition spike" | Low — flight risk is under-served | Predictive tools partially address this; most customers are anxious |
| **Social** | "Be seen as a data-driven HR leader, not a gut-feel practitioner" | Moderate — dashboard access helps | Any analytics tool with good visualization helps |
| **Consumption chain (before)** | "Get data out of multiple HR systems without an engineer" | Very low — data extraction is painful | We address this; Visier addresses this; it's a barrier to entry for the category |
| **Consumption chain (after)** | "Act on the insight — know what to do, not just what happened" | Very low — all analytics tools show "what," not "so what" | Almost nobody addresses this well |

### JTBD Competitive Assessment Decision Table

| Signal | Assessment | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Customers hire multiple products for same job | Partially — customers use us + HRIS reporting + ad hoc Excel | Integration opportunity: become the single source |
| Customers over-pay relative to job importance | Possibly — Visier's free tier implies some customers are over-paying for basic jobs | Unbundle: offer basic jobs at lower price; sell advanced jobs at higher price |
| Non-consumption is the main competitor | YES for new prospects — many sub-500 companies still use Excel/manual | Lower barriers to entry; free tier consideration |
| Customers describe "workarounds" | YES — "I export to Excel to do X" is the most common support request | Build the workaround into the product |

**The Most Under-Served Job:** "Know what to do, not just what happened." Every HR analytics tool produces charts. Almost none produce a recommended action. This is the job that is genuinely under-served and that an AI layer could address. Visier's free tier will not address this — it is a report generator, not an advisor. **The product that owns "recommended HR action based on your data" owns the most valuable layer of the JTBD stack.**

## Part 9: Blue Ocean Check — ERRC Grid

### Strategy Canvas — Current State

All major HR analytics players (Visier, Culture Amp, us) are competing on nearly identical dimensions:
- Feature breadth
- HRIS integration count
- Dashboard quality
- Customer support
- Security/compliance

When all players have similar strategy curves, Blue Ocean opportunity exists.

### The ERRC Grid — Our Recommended Move

| Factor | Eliminate | Reduce | Raise | Create |
|--------|:---------:|:------:|:-----:|:------:|
| Feature breadth competition (matching Visier's 200+ metrics) | | ✅ — stop competing on breadth | | |
| Generic HR benchmarks (enterprise-weighted, irrelevant to 200-employee company) | ✅ | | | |
| Implementation complexity (weeks-long onboarding) | | | ✅ | |
| Time-to-first-insight (current: days-weeks) | | | ✅ (target: <2 hours) | |
| Analytics UI sophistication | | ✅ | | |
| Natural language "advisor" capability (ask your data anything, get recommended action) | | | | ✅ |
| SMB-specific peer benchmarking (companies 50-500, by industry + geography) | | | | ✅ |
| HR/Finance bridge (workforce cost dashboards for CFO conversation) | | | | ✅ |
| Customer success as a product feature (QBRs, named CSM, visible in product) | | | ✅ | |

**The Blue Ocean Move:** Stop competing on the same dimensions as Visier (feature breadth, benchmarks, price). Create a new strategy curve that is:
- **Lower:** Less feature complexity, faster time-to-value
- **Higher:** AI-powered recommended actions, SMB peer benchmarks, CS as a visible product feature
- **New:** HR-to-CFO translation layer; natural language query interface

This is a value innovation move — it simultaneously reduces cost (less engineering on commodity features) and increases value (AI advisor, SMB benchmarks). Critically, it creates a new competitive arena that Visier cannot enter at freemium economics.

## Part 10: Technology Adoption Lifecycle Assessment

### Where is the HR Analytics Market (Sub-500 Segment)?

**Assessment: Early Majority, with pockets of Chasm stragglers**

| Evidence | Interpretation |
|---------|---------------|
| 150 customers at $30M ARR | Not Innovators/Early Adopters — this is a mature-enough market for dedicated tools |
| Visier launching free tier | Signal that Early Majority demand is now mainstream enough to justify PLG investment |
| "3 downgrades" signal | Pragmatist Early Majority buyers respond to price signals — they want proven value, not vision |
| 200% NRR | Customers who cross the chasm into the product find high value — whole product is being delivered |
| Non-consumption still significant | Some sub-200 employee companies haven't adopted yet — late chasm or late majority |

**Chasm Status:** We have crossed the chasm in our core segment. Visier's free tier is an attempt to make the crossing easier for companies that were stranded in the chasm (wanted the product, couldn't justify the cost or implementation effort).

**Whole Product Gap Analysis:**

For the Early Majority buyer in sub-500 employee HR analytics, the whole product requires:
- Core product (analytics + integrations): ✅ We deliver this
- References from similar companies: ✅ We have 150 customers; need more case studies
- Training and onboarding: ✅ We deliver this
- Customer community: ⚠️ Weak — Visier's scale gives them a better community
- AI capabilities: ❌ Missing — this is the next whole-product requirement as market matures
- HR/Finance bridge: ❌ Missing — CFO-facing workforce cost analysis is becoming expected
- Peer benchmarking at SMB scale: ⚠️ Weak vs. Visier's enterprise dataset

**For Late Majority buyers** (companies that haven't adopted yet, which Visier's free tier is now activating), the whole product requires lower barriers:
- Near-zero onboarding friction: ❌ Our implementation-heavy model is a barrier for this segment
- Self-serve configuration: ⚠️ Exists but requires training
- Free or trial entry point: ❌ Missing — this is what the free tier question is really about

**Bowling Alley Recommendation:**

We've won our "head pin" (HR analytics for growing tech/knowledge-work companies, 150-500 employees). Our next pin should be:
- **Vertical specialization:** Win HR analytics for [specific vertical — e.g., professional services firms 100-500 employees] completely before moving to the next vertical
- Why: References and benchmarks are vertical-specific; a win in professional services creates case studies that resonate with other professional services buyers; Visier's free tier is horizontal and generic

## Part 11: Win/Loss Pattern Analysis — Mapped to Framework Conclusions

### Hypothesized Win/Loss Patterns (Validate with Interviews This Week)

| Win/Loss Pattern | Likely Structural Cause | Framework Implication |
|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| "Visier is free now, we can't justify the cost" (downgrade pattern) | Christensen: over-served segment — basic jobs are sufficient at free tier | We are selling to a Segment A customer who needs a product tier, not our full product |
| "Visier has better benchmarking data" (competitive loss) | Cornered Resource: Visier's benchmark dataset is a durable moat | We need SMB-specific benchmark alternative; cannot replicate Visier's dataset |
| "Their team knew our business better" (competitive win) | Process Power + Relational Switching Costs: our CS model is our moat | Double down on structured discovery and customer success as a differentiator |
| "We didn't need all the features we were paying for" (downgrade) | JTBD: over-served on functional dimension; emotional/social jobs not met | Unbundle: right-size the offer, raise the value on emotional/social jobs |
| "We chose you because we couldn't rebuild our history elsewhere" (retention win) | 7 Powers: Switching Costs (Data/Migration type, customer-created) = 🟢 | Accelerate data history accumulation; make history portability a visible feature |
| "Visier was safer — they're the Gartner Leader" (competitive loss) | 7 Powers: Branding power active | Invest in analyst relations; seek Gartner positioning; build reference catalog |

### Win Rate Tracking Framework

Implement immediately in CRM:

| Metric | Target Baseline | Alert Threshold |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Competitive win rate vs. Visier | Measure now (no baseline) | Flag if <40% or declining >5pp quarter-over-quarter |
| No-decision rate (did nothing / went back to manual) | Measure now | Rising = market education problem |
| Churn competitive attribution (churned citing Visier) | Measure now | >20% of churns = structural competitive problem |
| Downgrade rate (paid → lower tier or free equivalent) | 3 in 30 days = elevated | >2 per month = crisis |

```

**H3 Strategic Implication:** The LLM-native HR analytics threat means our analytics UI is a 3-5 year asset. We need to be building the data and relationship layers that will persist after the UI is commoditized — benchmark data, workflow integration depth, and the relational trust that survives product disruption.

## Part 13: Asymmetric Competition Map

### How Each Competitor Is Actually Playing the Game

**Visier**
- **Optimizes for:** Data flywheel — every customer (paid or free) makes their benchmark dataset more valuable
- **Willing to sacrifice:** Near-term revenue from sub-500 segment (the free tier costs them essentially nothing at their infrastructure scale)
- **Time horizon:** 3-5 year platform bet; ROI on free tier is benchmark dataset + market share consolidation
- **Winning looks like:** 70%+ market share in HR analytics with the most comprehensive workforce benchmark dataset; every other player becomes a UI on top of Visier's data
- **Cost to add 1 user:** Near-zero at current scale — this is the asymmetry that makes the free tier sustainable for them and unsustainable to match for us

**Culture Amp**
- **Optimizes for:** Engagement-first relationship; analytics is a retention feature
- **Willing to sacrifice:** Analytics depth (it's a secondary product, not their core)
- **Time horizon:** 2-3 year expansion play; they want to be the "culture OS," not the analytics platform
- **Winning looks like:** HR teams use Culture Amp for engagement and stay for analytics — they never evaluate dedicated analytics tools
- **Cost to add 1 user:** Moderate — their analytics is a bundle add, not PLG

**Workday Peakon**
- **Optimizes for:** Workday HCM retention — analytics reduces HCM churn
- **Willing to sacrifice:** Standalone analytics revenue (it's not their core business)
- **Winning looks like:** Every Workday customer uses Peakon; standalone analytics becomes irrelevant in the Workday ecosystem
- **Cost to add 1 user:** Near-zero for Workday customers; high for non-Workday customers

**Our Product (as revealed by resource allocation):**
- **Optimizes for:** Customer success outcomes → NRR → ARR expansion
- **Willing to sacrifice:** New logo volume (high-touch model limits acquisition scale)
- **Time horizon:** 1-2 years; focused on installed base expansion
- **Winning looks like:** 150 customers become 150 deeply embedded, expanding accounts; new logos through referral
- **Cost to add 1 user:** Moderate-high (implementation-heavy model)

**The Asymmetry That Matters:** We are playing a relationship game. Visier is playing a data accumulation game. These are different wars. The mistake would be trying to match Visier's free tier (competing in their war, where they have structural advantage) rather than winning our war (where the relational model creates a moat they cannot match at freemium economics).

## Part 15: Strategic Recommendations — Cascaded to "So What"

### Recommendation 1: Launch a 90-Day AI Analytics Sprint

**Observation:** The analytics UI is commoditizing (Visier's free tier proves it), and the job that is genuinely under-served is "what should I do about this data?" [Tier 5: market signals; Tier 3: Gartner HR Tech trend reports; corroborated by JTBD analysis above]

**Implication:** The company that ships a credible "AI HR advisor" capability first — natural language queries + recommended actions for common HR situations (high attrition in engineering, compensation equity gap, forecast headcount needs) — will define the next premium layer of the market before Visier's $125M can build it.

**Response:** Scope a 90-day sprint to ship an NLP query interface that accepts a plain English question ("Why is attrition higher in Q3?") and returns a chart + a 3-sentence interpretation + a recommended action. This is not a full AI platform — it is a thin layer on top of existing analytics that delivers the most under-served job in the category.

**Confidence:** High that the job is under-served [Tier 3: customer feedback patterns]. Moderate that 90 days is achievable [dependent on engineering capacity]. Low confidence on competitive differentiation durability — Visier will build this too; the window is 12-18 months.

**Watch indicator:** Visier job postings for "AI product manager" or "LLM engineer" — if they appear in the next 60 days, their timeline is closer to 6 months than 18.

---

### Recommendation 2: Formalize and Market the Partnership Model as a Product Feature

**Observation:** Our Relational/Trust switching cost is 8/10 — higher than any competitor. But it is vendor-created (relationship with our CSM), not customer-created (embedded in their workflows). Vendor-created switching costs are erodable; customer-created are durable. [Tier 1: inferred from 200% NRR + switching cost analysis]

**Implication:** The partnership model is our actual competitive moat against Visier's free tier, but it is currently invisible in the market. Customers experience it but don't select us because of it in competitive evaluations.

**Response:** Launch a formal "HR Analytics Partnership Program" with:
1. Structured QBR process (quarterly, documented, with outcome metrics)
2. Named Customer Success partner for every account above $X ARR
3. "Benchmarking days" — twice-yearly, we bring peer group data and facilitate a session — this creates relational + data switching costs simultaneously
4. Make the program visible in the product: a dedicated "Partnership" section showing QBR history, action items, and outcomes

**Confidence:** High that this is differentiated from Visier's free tier model structurally. Moderate that it will translate to reduced churn in at-risk accounts. Depends on assumption that price is NOT the primary churn driver (validate with win/loss interviews).

**Watch indicator:** If win/loss interviews show price is the primary driver in >60% of cases, this recommendation needs to be paired with a price action, not replace it.

---

### Recommendation 3: Build the SMB HR Benchmark Dataset

**Observation:** Visier's Cornered Resource is a benchmark dataset built on large enterprise customers. [Tier 5: Visier marketing; Tier 3: analyst reports] The benchmarks it produces are most relevant for 1000+ employee companies, less so for 200-employee companies whose workforce dynamics differ materially (turnover rates, compensation bands, org structures all differ by size).

**Implication:** There is an unclaimed data asset: a peer benchmark dataset specifically for companies 50-500 employees, segmented by industry and geography. This is the benchmark our customers actually want and Visier's enterprise-weighted data cannot deliver.

**Response:** Launch a "Peer Benchmarking Consortium" — customers opt into anonymized data sharing and receive SMB-specific peer benchmarks in return. Start with 20-30 lighthouse customers in our top verticals. This is a 12-18 month asset-building effort, not a 90-day sprint.

**Confidence:** High that the market need exists [Tier 1: customer feedback on "how do we compare to companies our size?"]. Moderate that customers will opt in without privacy concerns — requires careful data governance design. Low confidence on timeline — benchmark data products are hard to build credibly.

**Watch indicator:** If Visier announces they're extending their benchmark dataset to sub-500 companies (enabled by free tier data), accelerate this initiative immediately.

---

### Recommendation 4: Segment and Right-Price the Product Line

**Observation:** 3 customer downgrades suggest Segment A customers (basic HR reporting, no predictive analytics, low integration depth) are over-paying relative to job importance. Visier's free tier is a credible alternative for them. [Tier 1: behavioral data — 3 downgrades; Tier 5: Visier announcement]

**Implication:** Attempting to retain Segment A customers at current pricing is a losing battle. The correct move is to either right-price for Segment A or deliberately migrate them to a lower tier — keeping them in your ecosystem with lower revenue rather than losing them to Visier.

**Response:** Design a product tier architecture:
- **Tier 1 (Starter, $X/month or freemium for sub-50):** Core reporting, 3 HRIS integrations, no predictive analytics, community support only. Purpose: capture non-consumption and retain Segment A at a sustainable price point.
- **Tier 2 (Growth, current pricing):** Full analytics suite, predictive models, dedicated integrations, email support. Current product.
- **Tier 3 (Partnership, premium):** Everything in Growth + dedicated CSM + QBRs + benchmarking consortium + AI advisory. Highest ACVs; defensible against Visier.

**Confidence:** Moderate that this is the right architecture. Depends on gross margin analysis (can we sustain a starter tier?) and engineering capacity (can we scope the right feature gates?). High confidence that doing nothing on pricing will accelerate Segment A churn.

**Watch indicator:** The "right-size" signal is in your feature utilization data. If >40% of customers use <30% of the product, the over-serving is structural and a product tier is the solution.

## Part 16: Scenario Analysis

### Three-Scenario Framework

| Scenario | Probability | Key Driver | Response |
|----------|:-----------:|------------|----------|
| 🟢 **Base Case:** Visier's free tier primarily captures non-consumers and light users; our installed base retention holds at >90%; new logo growth slows 20-30% | 50% | Win/loss data shows price is NOT the primary driver in >60% of decisions | Execute Recommendations 1-3; hold on freemium decision until Day 90 |
| 🔵 **Bull Case:** Visier's free tier creates a rising tide that expands the overall market; our segment-specific positioning and AI layer creates a pricing umbrella; we grow 40%+ | 20% | Our AI advisory layer ships credibly within 90 days; SMB benchmark resonates; market expansion lifts all boats | Accelerate hiring; raise a growth round on the AI narrative |
| 🔴 **Bear Case:** Free tier creates cascade effect; 15-20 churns in next 90 days; win rate drops to <30% vs. Visier; new logo pipeline dries up | 30% | Win/loss data shows price IS the primary driver; feature gap is real; Visier's sales team executes aggressively | Emergency board meeting; fast-track freemium; consider strategic partnership or M&A exploration |

**What Would Falsify the Base Case?** Win/loss interviews show price as primary driver in >50% of losses; NPS scores show customer satisfaction erosion; win rate vs. Visier drops below 40% in next pipeline review.

## What Goes on the CEO's Desk Monday

### The One-Page

**Situation:** Visier raised $125M and launched a free tier for our exact segment. 3 customers downgraded in 30 days. This is a structural competitive move, not a promotional event.

**The Insight:** Visier's free tier is an Aggregation Theory play — they're acquiring data and relationships at zero cost today, planning to monetize at scale in 18-24 months. Every company that signs up, even free, makes their benchmark dataset more valuable and harder to replicate. The real threat is not our existing 150 customers; it is the 50 customers we were going to win in the next 12 months who will now try Visier first.

**What we will NOT do:** Match their free tier without understanding our unit economics. Panic-discount at scale. Announce products we can't ship.

**What we ARE doing right now:**
1. Calling the 3 downgraders personally to understand what actually happened
2. Auditing all 150 accounts for switching cost depth (our real churn risk map)
3. Building competitive intelligence on what the free tier actually includes
4. Assigning senior coverage to the top 20 at-risk accounts

**The 90-day decision we need to make:** Launch AI advisory layer (90-day sprint, est. $X engineering cost) + formalize Partnership Program + design product tier with right-priced entry point. This is our counter-positioning response.

**What I need from you:** Approval on commercial flexibility for at-risk account retention ($X maximum concession budget). Decision on AI sprint investment ($X engineering). Alignment that we are counter-positioning on partnership quality, not matching Visier's free tier.

**Confidence in this plan:** Moderate — we are 7 days away from the win/loss data that will either confirm or revise this strategy. The 30-day triage gives us the intelligence to decide with confidence what to do next.
