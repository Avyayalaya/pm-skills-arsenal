# Case Study: Art Gallery Expansion Strategy

**Scenario:** Maya runs Lumina Gallery, a contemporary art space in Portland. After 4 years, she has steady foot traffic and a small collector base, but revenue plateaued at $180K/year. She knows she needs to grow but feels paralyzed by competing ideas: expand the physical space, launch an online store, host more events, or start an art advisory service. She has 8 hours/week to work ON the business (not just IN it).

**Time:** 75 minutes
**Output:** 4 artifacts ready to execute
**Investment:** $0 (uses existing data + customer conversations)

---

## The Chain

### 1. Problem Framing (15 min)

**Input:** "I want to grow my gallery — maybe double revenue? I don't know where to start. Should I expand the space, go online, or something else?"

**Process:** Applied Problem Framing skill's decomposition method + ICE scoring.

**Output: Problem Definition Document** (abbreviated)

```
DECOMPOSED PROBLEMS

Problem A: New Customer Acquisition
- Current: 12 new collectors/year (Instagram + walk-ins)
- Opportunity: Competitor galleries average 28 new collectors/year
- Impact: 8/10 | Confidence: 7/10 | Ease: 4/10
- ICE Score: 6.3
- Load-bearing assumption: Maya has time to nurture 16 additional leads

Problem B: Increase Purchase Frequency (Existing Collectors)
- Current: 47 collectors, avg 1.3 purchases/year
- Opportunity: If frequency → 2.5x/year, revenue +$89K
- Impact: 9/10 | Confidence: 8/10 | Ease: 7/10
- ICE Score: 8.0
- Load-bearing assumption: Collectors WANT more guidance (not just more art)

Problem C: Corporate Art Consulting (New Revenue Stream)
- Current: $0 from corporate clients
- Opportunity: 3 local businesses asked about "office art packages" in past year
- Impact: 7/10 | Confidence: 5/10 | Ease: 3/10
- ICE Score: 5.0
- Load-bearing assumption: Maya has capacity to service B2B clients

PRIORITIZATION: Problem B (increase collector purchase frequency)
- Highest ICE score
- Leverages existing warm relationships
- Fits within 8 hrs/week constraint
```

**Key insight:** The highest-leverage opportunity isn't acquiring NEW customers — it's serving existing collectors better. They already trust Maya; the question is whether they want more from her.

**Handoff to Discovery:** Validate the core hypothesis — "Do existing collectors want curatorial guidance beyond what they get during gallery visits?" Test through 8 structured interviews + behavioral data analysis (Instagram DMs, email inquiries, past purchase patterns).

---

### 2. Discovery & Research (25 min)

**Input:** Problem Framing identified "increase collector purchase frequency" as highest-leverage. Hypothesis: collectors want ongoing curatorial guidance, not just transactional art sales.

**Process:** Applied Discovery & Research skill's Stated vs. Revealed framework.

**Data sources:**
- 8 collector interviews (45 min each, conducted over 2 weeks)
- Instagram analytics (Jan-Dec 2025: 847 profile visits, 134 DMs, 23 inquiries about "similar artists")
- Sales data (July 2024 - Jan 2026: 47 collectors, 61 total purchases, avg $2,890/purchase)
- Competitor observation (3 galleries visited, websites reviewed)

**Output: Research Synthesis Brief** (abbreviated)

```
STATED PREFERENCES (T2 Evidence)
From 8 collector interviews:
- 7/8 said: "I wish I knew when new pieces arrived that match my taste"
- 6/8 said: "I feel overwhelmed by art fairs — I'd pay for help"
- 5/8 said: "I want to build a cohesive collection, not random buys"
- 3/8 said: "I'd spend more if I had a structured budget/plan"

REVEALED PREFERENCES (T1 Evidence)
Behavioral signals from existing data:
- Instagram DMs: 23 inquiries asked "Do you have more [artist X] style pieces?"
  → Indicates collectors want curation beyond current inventory
- Purchase patterns: 12 collectors bought 2+ pieces; avg time between
  purchases = 4.2 months (not seasonally driven)
  → Suggests willingness to buy more frequently with prompting
- Email open rates: "New Arrivals" emails = 34% open; "Artist Spotlight"
  emails = 58% open
  → Collectors want context/narrative, not just product announcements

COMPETITOR BENCHMARKS (T1 Evidence)
- Gallery X (Seattle): offers "Art Advisory" tier ($500/year membership)
  → Members buy avg 3.8x/year vs. non-members 1.4x/year
- Gallery Y (Denver): hosts quarterly "Collector Dinners" (invite-only)
  → Attendees account for 67% of annual revenue despite being 18% of list

GAP ANALYSIS
Stated preference: "I want help building a collection"
Revealed behavior: Collectors engage MORE with narrative content than product
Competitor evidence: Structured advisory relationships = 2.7x purchase frequency

CONFIDENCE: HIGH (H)
- Stated and revealed preferences align (rare!)
- Competitor data validates demand exists
- Small sample size (8 interviews) but 100% directional consistency
```

**Key insight:** Collectors aren't asking for "more art" — they're asking for "help knowing WHICH art." This is a relationship design problem, not an inventory problem.

**Handoff to Narrative:** Position the advisory service as an EXTENSION of the existing relationship (not a new transactional product). Frame it as "Your taste, curated" — Maya already knows their preferences; this makes her ongoing guidance explicit and structured.

---

### 3. Narrative Building (20 min)

**Input:** Discovery confirmed demand for curatorial guidance. Positioning must feel like relationship depth, not a sales tactic.

**Process:** Applied Narrative Building skill's Strategic Narrative Arc framework.

**Output: Strategic Narrative for "Lumina Collective"** (advisory service)

```
TARGET AUDIENCE: Existing collectors who've purchased 1+ pieces

NARRATIVE ARC

Setup (Current State)
"You bought your first piece from Lumina because something resonated. Maybe it
was the color, the artist's story, or the way it made you feel. You return to
the gallery because you trust Maya's eye — she doesn't sell you art; she
introduces you to artists."

Tension (The Problem)
"But between gallery visits, you're on your own. You see art at fairs, online,
in friends' homes. You wonder: 'Would this fit my collection? Is this artist
worth investing in? Am I building something cohesive, or just accumulating
random pieces?' You want to be intentional, but you don't have Maya in your
pocket when decisions arise."

Resolution (The Change)
"Lumina Collective makes Maya's guidance ongoing. Not a subscription to buy
more art — a partnership to build YOUR collection with intention."

HOW IT WORKS (The Proof)
1. Intake: 90-min session mapping your taste, space, budget, goals
2. Ongoing: Monthly curated recommendations (3 pieces: 1 stretch, 2 accessible)
3. Access: Text/email Maya when you see art elsewhere ("Is this worth it?")
4. Events: Quarterly private studio visits with emerging artists
5. Planning: Annual collection review + next-year roadmap

Investment: $1,200/year (paid quarterly) — equivalent to 2 coffee meetings/month

WHY NOW
"Three collectors asked in the past 6 months: 'Can I just pay you to tell me
what to buy?' This makes that official."

WHY MAYA (Unique Authority)
"You already trust her taste. This doesn't change the relationship — it
deepens it."

POSITIONING STATEMENT
"Lumina Collective is for collectors who want to build, not just buy. It's
Maya's eye, on retainer."
```

**Key insight:** The service can't feel like "premium upsell" — it has to feel like formalizing something collectors were already asking for informally. The narrative leans into existing trust rather than creating new sales pressure.

**Handoff to Spec:** Translate this narrative into operational detail. Define scope boundaries (what's included vs. excluded), success metrics (retention > churn), and pilot structure (5 collectors, 6-month commitment, feedback loops built in).

---

### 4. Specification Writing (15 min)

**Input:** Narrative positioned advisory service as relationship formalization, not new product. Need operational blueprint to pilot.

**Process:** Applied Specification Writing skill's Scope + Acceptance Criteria + Failure Conditions framework.

**Output: Lumina Collective Service Specification** (abbreviated)

```
SERVICE DEFINITION
Advisory service providing ongoing curatorial guidance to help collectors build
intentional art collections.

TARGET PILOT
- 5 existing collectors (invited, not marketed broadly)
- 6-month commitment (Feb - July 2026)
- $1,200/year ($300 quarterly, pay-as-you-go for pilot)

SCOPE: WHAT'S INCLUDED
1. Onboarding Session (90 min)
   - Taste mapping exercise (past purchases, inspiration images, aspirations)
   - Space assessment (photos + layout discussion)
   - Budget + timeline (what's realistic in next 12 months?)
   - Output: Collector Profile Document

2. Monthly Curated Recommendations
   - 3 pieces: 1 stretch ($5K+), 2 accessible ($1-3K)
   - Context: why these fit the collector's taste + collection arc
   - Delivery: email + 15-min call if collector wants to discuss
   - Timing: first Monday of each month

3. On-Demand Guidance (Text/Email)
   - Collector sees art elsewhere, sends photo: "Worth it?"
   - Maya responds within 48 hrs (weekdays)
   - Limit: 4 inquiries/month (prevents scope creep)

4. Quarterly Studio Visits
   - Private access to 1-2 emerging artists' studios
   - Group size: max 8 collectors (mix of Collective + invited guests)
   - Timing: last Saturday of Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec

5. Annual Collection Review
   - End-of-year session: what was acquired, how collection evolved
   - Next-year roadmap: focus areas, budget allocation, wishlist
   - Output: Collection Development Plan

SCOPE: WHAT'S EXCLUDED
- Not art procurement (Maya doesn't buy on collector's behalf)
- Not framing/installation service (existing vendors handle this)
- Not appraisal/valuation (outside Maya's expertise)
- Not 24/7 access (boundaries protect Maya's capacity)

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (Success = Pilot → Full Launch)
1. Retention: ≥4/5 collectors renew after 6 months (80%)
2. Purchase frequency: Pilot collectors buy avg 2.5x in 6 months
   (vs. baseline 1.3x/year = 0.65 purchases/6mo)
3. NPS: ≥8/10 when asked "Would you recommend Lumina Collective?"
4. Operational feasibility: Maya spends ≤6 hrs/week on service delivery

FAILURE CONDITIONS (Triggers to Pause/Pivot)
- If collector churn from broader gallery list rises >5% during pilot
  → Advisory service may be alienating non-members
- If Maya's weekly time >8 hrs for 3+ consecutive weeks
  → Service isn't scalable at current pricing
- If pilot collectors' purchase frequency <1.5x in 6 months
  → Service isn't driving intended behavior change

PILOT LOGISTICS
Week 1 (Feb 24): Invite 8 collectors (expect 5-6 yes)
Week 2-3: Schedule onboarding sessions
Week 4: Deliver first monthly recommendations
Month 2-6: Execute service as specified
Month 7: Pilot retrospective + decision (scale, pivot, or kill)

NEXT STEPS (Immediate Actions)
1. Draft invitation email (use Narrative's "why now" framing)
2. Create Collector Profile Template (onboarding session structure)
3. Set up Notion workspace (track recommendations, feedback, logistics)
4. Calendar block: 6 hrs/week for Collective delivery (Tue AM + Thu PM)
```

**Outcome:** Maya now has a pilot-ready service spec. She can invite 5 collectors this week, deliver the first onboarding session next week, and know within 6 months whether this becomes a core revenue stream or a learning experience.

## What This Demonstrates

### Skills Work Beyond Software Product Management
- Problem Framing's ICE scoring works for small business prioritization
- Discovery's Stated vs. Revealed framework applies to Instagram DMs and sales patterns
- Narrative Building positions services, not just products
- Specification Writing defines "done" for relationship design, not feature delivery

### Evidence Tiers Apply to Small Business Data
- **T1 (Behavioral):** Instagram analytics, purchase frequency, email open rates
- **T2 (Stated):** Collector interviews, DM inquiries, competitor observations
- **T3 (Inferred):** Opportunity sizing based on competitor benchmarks

The framework doesn't require enterprise-scale data — it works with 47 customers and 8 interviews.

### O→I→R→C→W Cascade Works for Service Design
- **Observation:** Collectors open "Artist Spotlight" emails 2x more than "New Arrivals"
- **Implication:** They want narrative/context, not just product announcements
- **Response:** Advisory service leads with curation (context), not inventory (product)
- **Confidence:** HIGH (stated + revealed preferences align)
- **Watch Indicator:** If pilot collectors' email open rates drop, positioning may be wrong

### Skill Chaining Produces Executable Strategy in <90 Minutes
Each skill's output explicitly feeds the next:
1. **Problem Framing → Discovery:** "Validate collector purchase frequency hypothesis"
2. **Discovery → Narrative:** "Position as relationship extension, not new product"
3. **Narrative → Spec:** "Translate positioning into operational blueprint"
4. **Spec → Execution:** Maya has pilot invites ready to send tomorrow

### Realistic Constraints = Realistic Solutions
- Maya has 8 hrs/week (not unlimited capacity)
- Gallery has 47 collectors (not thousands of users)
- Budget is $0 (no paid acquisition, no tech build)
- Timeline is 6 months (pilot-sized, not multi-year roadmap)

The skills adapt to solopreneur reality — you don't need a team, a budget, or a SaaS product to apply rigorous PM thinking.

## Try This for Your Business

If you're a solopreneur or small business owner, you can run this exact chain:

1. **Problem Framing (15 min):** Write down your vague goal ("grow revenue"). Decompose into 3 specific problems. Score each with ICE. Pick the highest.

2. **Discovery (25 min):** Talk to 5-8 customers. Pull your analytics. Compare stated preferences (what they say) vs. revealed preferences (what they do). Look for alignment.

3. **Narrative (20 min):** Write the positioning for your offer. Setup → Tension → Resolution. Make it feel like you're solving THEIR problem, not selling YOUR thing.

4. **Spec (15 min):** Define what's included, what's excluded, success metrics, and failure conditions. Make it pilot-sized (5-10 customers, 3-6 months).

**Total investment:** 75 minutes + customer conversations.
**Total cost:** $0.
**Output:** A pilot you can launch next week.

The PM Skills Arsenal isn't just for product managers — it's for anyone who needs to turn "I want to grow" into "Here's what I'm testing next week."
