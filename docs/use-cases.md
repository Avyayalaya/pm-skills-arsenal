# Use Cases

Detailed demonstrations of each PM skill applied to recognizable real products and competitive scenarios.

Each use case includes:
- Full framework application with scoring rubrics and decision tables
- Evidence tier annotations (T1-T6) on every substantive claim
- H/M/L confidence levels on strategic conclusions
- O→I→R→C→W cascade for all recommendations
- Assumption registries and adversarial self-critiques

These are not templates or toy examples — they demonstrate the level of depth and rigor the skills produce when applied to real strategic questions.
