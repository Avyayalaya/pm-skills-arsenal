# Case Studies

Multi-skill workflows demonstrating how PM Skills Arsenal works across a complete product development cycle.

Each case study chains multiple skills together:
- **Art Gallery Expansion** — Problem Framing → Discovery → Narrative → Spec (4 skills, 75 min)
- **Meditation App Engagement** — Problem Framing → Discovery → Metric Design → Spec → Narrative (5 skills, 110 min)

These show not just individual skill application, but how outputs from one skill become inputs to the next — the complete artifact chain from vague problem statement to shippable specification.
